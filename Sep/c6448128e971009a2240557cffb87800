Zamokuhle Hadebe (43) and his girlfriend Zandile Mdunge, (42), her two children, Philasande (5), three-year-old Mnqobi and niece Ntombi (9) were in the four-roomed house when it caught alight.

A Witness reporter who visited the scene on Monday morning stated in Tuesday’s article that human remains could be seen under a bucket on the ash-strewn property. It was also reported that relatives said they feared stray dogs would scavenge the remains and that forensic investigators were expected to visit the home again yesterday to scout for more human remains and begin the investigations. Pietermaritzburg police spokesperson Sergeant Mthokozisi Ngobese said on Tuesday that the K9 Search and Rescue team had not been called out. When asked why remains were seen at the home on Monday, he said that there were no remains there. He added that all human remains had been removed and forensics as well as fire personnel and experts were on scene immediately to investigate the fire. He said reports suggest that the cause of the fire was “electricity-related”.
