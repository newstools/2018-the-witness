The
KwaZulu-Natal Inland top-order batsman Kyle Nipper says being a new father has
helped him to become a better cricketer and that’s why he has begun his individual
season on a high. The
30-year-old left-handed batsman welcomed his daughter, Tenley Joy, into the
world three weeks ago. And
this past weekend, Nipper was probably the best player for Inland in their
otherwise unsuccessful Africa T20 Cup. Against
Uganda, the Pietermaritzburg player scored 77 runs from 45 balls and then
scored 67 from 46 balls in the derby against KZN Inland on Sunday to finish the
T20 Cup as Inland’s leading run scorer. “Being
a father has been good, it gives me a new perspective on cricket. It has made
me realise it is just a game and I have bigger and better things to go home to
now,” said Nipper. “I’m
playing without fear now because I know I can go home to be with her afterwards
and now whenever I play, I want to make her proud.” Nipper
is happy with the way he started the season, but he would have been much
happier if his exploits had been enough to guide the Pietermaritzburg-based
outfit to the semi-finals of the T20 Cup title. Going
into this year’s edition of the competition a lot was expected from Nipper and
his team-mates as they were the defending champions. “I
think we let ourselves down, we didn’t step up to the plate and weren’t our
best. And it’s always hard being the defending champions because everyone wants
to beat you, but ja, it’s one of those things,” said Nipper. “It’s
always nice to get a few runs, but it’s bittersweet that the team didn’t win. I
would much rather us winning games than me not scoring than it being the other
way around.”
