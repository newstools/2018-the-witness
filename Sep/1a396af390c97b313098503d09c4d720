A Prestbury mother is desperately searching for her 12-year-old daughter who she believes might have run away from home on Monday afternoon. Nokulunga Zondo said her daughter, Naledi, went missing on Monday at around 5.30pm. Zondo said Naledi’s teachers and classmates at Prestbury Primary School said they last saw her on Monday when she left school. The mother said Naledi had returned home as normal on Monday afternoon. “I work in Durban and always come back home on Fridays, when I left home for work on Monday everything was normal. I got a call that my child was missing on Monday at around 6pm and after my relatives went looking for her in the area and couldn’t find her I drove straight home.” She said they reported the matter to the police and have been looking for her ever since. “We’ve looked at hospitals, parks and even asked around at homeless shelters but we haven’t had any luck. “I am honestly losing my mind and need to find my daughter. I need her to come back home safely and ask anyone with any information to please help me find her,” said Zondo. Naledi was last seen wearing blue jeans and a black sweater with pink piping on the front. Her hair is plaited into three lines and she has a small scar on her upper lip. Pietermaritzburg police spokesperson Captain Khosi Khonjelwayo said a missing persons case was opened at Prestbury police station and officers were out looking for the girl. Khonjelwayo urged anyone with any information to contact the warrant officer Ntuli on 033 845 7756/7.
