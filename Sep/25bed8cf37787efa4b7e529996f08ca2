The Hayfields woman who went missing last Friday has been found unharmed. Shaista Naipal, a physiotherapist who was last seen on CCTV footage outside MediClinic Hospital, was found by a colleague on Chief Albert Luthuli (Commercial) Road on Tuesday night. Her brother, Nasteesh, did not want to divulge details around the ordeal as it could jeopardise police investigations, but said: “All I can reveal is that she was dropped off by the assailants on Commercial Road close to MediClinic.” He said another physiotherapist, who works at MediClinic, was driving home that evening when he spotted Shaista walking on the road. “He noticed the grey hoodie and that is when he picked her up,” he said. Nasteesh said that the family was relieved to have found his sister unharmed. “She’s safe and sound despite being in a state of shock. She is still a bit shaken after the ordeal.” Police spokesperson Captain Khosi Khonjelwayo said Shaista was due to give a statement to police on Thursday. The Witness reported on Wednesday that she had phoned her family shortly after being taken on Friday night, saying she had been kidnapped.
