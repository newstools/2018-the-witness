KwaZulu-Natal Premier Willies Mchunu on Wednesday confirmed he will be releasing the Moerane Commission report on political killings to the public on Thursday. “The commission’s findings and recommendations will be tabled in the legislature and released to the public,” the Premier’s spokesperson Thami Ngidi said. The announcement puts to an end speculations that the provincial government planned to further delay the release of the document. There have been rumours that the ANC in KZN wanted the release of the report delayed to allow the party time to deal with the fallout caused by witness statements implicating ANC members in the killings. However, the ANC have rubbished the rumours. “We don’t know what’s inside the report; we have not seen it. Like anybody else, we will only be able to go through the document once it is tabled in the legislature,” ANC provincial spokesperson Nomagugu Simelane-Zulu said. Established by Premier Willies Mchunu two years ago, the Moerane Commission was investigating the causes of the province’s political violence, estimated to have claimed 100 lives since 2011. The report was handed to Mchunu in June. Mchunu will table the report in the provincial legislature where it will be debated by political parties. The 460-page report will then be made available to the media and the public. Meanwhile, eight people will appear in the Pietermaritzburg Regional Court on Thursday in connection with the murder of ANC local activist Musawenkosi “Maqatha” Mchunu, who was gunned down at his home in KwaPata in May. The eight are part of the 23 people that were nabbed by police in recent weeks after being linked to several political murders. The DA said it will use Thursday’s debate in the legislature to register the party’s concerns about political killings.
