The family of slain ANC Midlands activist Musawenkosi “Maqatha” Mchunu have hired a team of lawyers to represent them as an affected party in the murder case. Mchunu’s nephew, Bonginkosi Zuma, said the team of lawyers will be watching the case closely and identifying any loopholes that could jeopardise the case. Eight people arrested in connection with Mchunu’s murder, including ward 10 councillor Nkosinathi “TK” Gambu, are due to appear at the Pietermaritzburg Magistrate’s Court again on Thursday for a formal bail application. Mchunu, who was critical of the Moses Mabhida regional executive committee, was shot and killed in his driveway in May. Mchunu had led several marches calling for the disbandment of the ANC regional leadership prior to his killing. The regional leadership was subsequently disbanded by the ANC provincial leadership in June. Speaking during a press conference held at Mchunu’s home in KwaPata on Monday, Zuma said the team of lawyers will be present at court on Thursday. “It’s not that we do not trust our justice system. Their role is to follow up with various agencies and ensure that justice is served. “They will also be assisting us as a family to understand some of the complex legal issues along the way. We will continue to seek justice for Qashana. We will not rest until that is fulfilled and we will ensure that it is so,” said Zuma, who was flanked by Mchunu’s two wives, Buyile and Lungile Mchunu. A family member, Lindinkosi Mchunu, said they were hoping that eight people arrested in the case will not be granted bail. “It was bad enough when we did not know who the killers were. It would totally destroy us as the family to see them roaming the streets. “What is making it worse, is that they are our neighbours. As the family, we are still trying to deal with our brother’s killing. We are still devastated. His children will grow up without knowing their father,” he said. Mchunu’s wives were too distraught to speak to the media on Monday.
