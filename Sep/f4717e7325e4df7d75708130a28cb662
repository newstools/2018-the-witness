The search for 12-year-old Naledi Zondo enters its fourth day on today, Friday. While the search for Naledi continues, another Pietermaritzburg woman has raised the alarm about her 17-year-old sister, Sanelisiwe Happiness Buthelezi, who was last seen on August 5 near their home on Ghandi Road, Northdale. Zama Buthelezi-Zuma, who lives with her husband down the road from where Sanelisiwe stays with their older brother, said the teenager had come to collect her monthly stipend from her. “I walked her back home but left her half way. That was the last time we saw or heard from her,” she said. Sanelisiwe was last seen wearing a long green dress and a pink jacket. Buthelezi-Zuma said Sanelisiwe suffers from a mental condition after she had a stroke in December last year. She had stopped attending school. “We did not report her missing immediately as this is not the first time she went missing. The last time she went missing we were able to find her without police intervention but this time we are starting to panic because we have looked for her everywhere but we haven’t been able to find her,” said Buthezi-Zuma. The worried sister reported the matter to the police on Sunday. Buthelezi-Zuma said she went into “panic-mode” when she learnt on Tuesday morning that there was another young Pietermaritzburg girl, Naledi, who went missing. “People have been sending me messages about there being cars abducting young girls and trafficking them. I am seriously going crazy. I am praying that my baby sister will return home alive and unharmed. “My greatest fear is that someone might have abducted her and has her locked up somewhere abusing her. Sane is very fragile and needs to be around people who will take care of her. If she had left willingly I think she would be back home now, something is not right,” said Buthelezi-Zuma. She said she has been receiving great support from the Pietermaritzburg community as a search party is being formed to look for Sanelisiwe today.
