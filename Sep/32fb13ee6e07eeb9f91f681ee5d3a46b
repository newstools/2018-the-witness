With a knife held to her neck and another held to the neck of her student driver, a Durban woman shot and killed one of six men who tried to hijack her on Saturday. The woman, who is a driving instructor, had a learner driver with her in the car when the incident occurred. The pair were driving along Old Main Road in Pinetown on Saturday morning and as they neared the traffic lights, six men with knives approached them. The woman, who asked not to be named, said one of the men got his hand through the window and unlocked all the car doors. She said a man went to the learner driver and held a knife against the learner’s neck while another man held a knife to her throat. Provincial police spokesperson Colonel Thembeka Mbele said the women were robbed of their belongings including cellphones. The other four men had tried to get into the back seat of the car when the woman warned the man holding the knife to her throat to stop what he was doing. She asked the man multiple times to leave them alone as she had a firearm. After warning the men, Mbele said the woman drew her firearm and “fatally shot” one of the men. Mbele said the other men fled from the scene on foot. The instructor said the whole ordeal had not been easy and that she had been feeling “a lot of different emotions, especially anxiety”. “My family and friends have been very supportive,” said the instructor. “I have been an instructor for 17-and-a-half years and I have never had an experience like this.” She added that the learner driver had not taken the incident well but that she also had lots of people supporting her. “The challenge now is to return to work,” she said. “People say stay away from certain routes and divert from my normal routes, but it is difficult.”
