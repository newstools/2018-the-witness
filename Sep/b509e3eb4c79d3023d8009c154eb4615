Another boy who was allegedly sexually assaulted by school counsellor Darren Goddard said “he was a good man and then he decided to do naughty things”. The 12-year-old was the fourth boy to testify so far in the Pietermaritzburg high court in the sexual assault and rape trial of Goddard. The boy was allegedly sexually assaulted during 2015 and 2016 when he was at the school where Goddard was a guidance counsellor. He said Goddard used to make him sit on his lap, hug him tightly and put his hands in his pants and play with his private parts. He said that when the assault was over, Goddard would hug him and kiss him on the head. The boy said he felt happy at this stage because he knew it was time for him to go back to his classroom. He also said that just before he would leave the office, Goddard would playfully slap his behind. He said he did not like it when he was touched inappropriately. Under cross-examination by Goddard’s advocate Shane Matthews, the boy agreed that the counsellor would “comfort” him when he used to cry because of being bullied. The boy also agreed that he had seen Goddard as being his friend. The advocate suggested to the boy that Goddard denies that he’d picked him up and put him on his lap, but the boy insisted that it happened. Matthews also put it to the boy that Goddard will say he would put his hand around him when he was crying. The boy said yes. When Matthews said Goddard never touched him inappropriately, the boy said he did. Goddard also denies playfully hitting the boy’s behind. The case has been adjourned to Monday.
