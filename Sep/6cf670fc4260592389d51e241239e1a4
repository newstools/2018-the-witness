Self-taught Pietermaritzburg fashion designer Kireshen Chetty (pictured), who was one of 12 contestants on Mzansi Magic’s Project Runway SA television show, has made it into the top three and is the only remaining contestant from KwaZulu-Natal. For Chetty, the call to fashion was far greater than an office-based job as a qualified architect, which saw him trying to juggle his day-time job with his passion for being a fashion designer. The Northdale-born man said he was “extremely excited” that he has made it into the top three of the competition. “I am really ready to represent KwaZulu-Natal as well as my home-town Pietermaritzburg and hopefully bring this home. I still can’t believe I made it this far considering that I was the underdog in the competition. I was the only self-taught designer competing against some of the country’s well established designers,” he said. The competition has been “hectic”, he said. “It’s not easy not knowing your fate every week. There were times where I thought I’d be eliminated in the competition but clearly the judges saw something in my work and that’s kept me in the competition until this point.” The show’s finale will be aired on Tuesday next week on Mzansi Magic’s channel 161 at 9.30 pm where the Project Runway SA winner will be announced. “Winning the competition would mean the world to me. This show has given me the platform to show what I am capable of,” said Chetty. “For me it was mostly about getting the recognition in the fashion industry, but winning the ultimate prize, which includes a chance to showcase my work at Paris Fashion Week, would be amazing."
