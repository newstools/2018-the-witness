Umgeni Water has reassured residents that there appears to be no imminent problem of water shortages as there seems to be sufficient water at the moment. This comes after messages were being circulated on social networks claiming that there is a critical drought on the horizon that will affect residents in the Howick, Pietermaritzburg and Durban areas. Umgeni Water spokesperson Shami Harichunder said the average total water storage of the Mgeni System was by November 30, 2018, at 67% whereas at the same time a year ago it was at 54%. Harichunder said the Mgeni System was estimated to feed four million consumers in the uMgungundlovu, Msunduzi and eThekwini areas and is the biggest system under Umgeni Water. As of Monday, Harichunder said the water levels at dams under the Mgeni System were as follows: Mearns Dam at 52% full, Spring Grove Dam at 56%, Midmar Dam at 94%, Albert Falls Dam at 40%, Nagel at 59% and Inanda Dam at 62%. He said at the same time last year the dam levels at Mearns Dam was 70%, Spring Grove Dam was at 72%, Midmar Dam was at 77%, Albert Falls Dam was at 19%, Nagel was at 79% and Inanda Dam was at 61%. “The current water level in the Mgeni System is considered acceptable and represents no risk of non-supply,” he said. Harichunder also said Umgeni Water has been experiencing technical problems with their website as some residents had noticed that the daily dam levels were last updated in November 2018. He said they were working on the problem and will be uploading the daily dam levels soon.
