Another teenager is recovering after surviving a fall down the Karkloof Falls at the weekend. A 13-year-old boy, from Durban, was hospitalised after falling about nine metres off the Karkloof Falls, around the Woodhouse Falls area, on Saturday morning while on an outing with friends. Netcare 911 spokesperson Shawn Herbst said paramedics responded to the accident at around 11.30 am. He said the boy had sustained moderate injuries and was in severe pain. “He was treated on scene by an advanced life support paramedic. The Pietermaritzburg police Search and Rescue Unit set up a rope rescue system with a specialised stretcher to carry the boy to a safe place.” This was the second such accident at the falls in four days and the third in just three months. On Wednesday, a dramatic rescue involving paramedics and locals played out when a 14-year-old boy fell about 50 metres down the Karkloof Falls while also on an outing with friends. He was airlifted to Mediclinic Pietermaritzburg where he was reported to be in the intensive care unit on Thursday. His condition is not known. In October The Witness reported on another accident in which a Howick couple, Mar-Louise (29) and Andre Pretorius (31), survived after they fell 35 metres from the Karkloof Falls. A reliable source, who was present at all three accidents, told The Witness that all the accidents happened at the same spot. The teen’s father, Collin Hill, told The Witness on Sunday that his family was camping at Albert Falls when his son went to the Karkloof Falls picnic area with a group of friends. “He wasn’t actually walking at the edge of the falls, he was away from the falls walking in the shallow water.” Hill said because the rocks have green algae, it becomes very slippery when wet. “He is so fortunate. There are no broken bones and no stitches. He is battered and bruised and sore like hell but there’s nothing broken."
