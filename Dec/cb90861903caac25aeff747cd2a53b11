A Policeman was on Monday handed a one-year suspended sentence for assaulting the then chairperson of a local Community Policing Forum (CPF) and an attorney. Neil Inderjeeth assaulted Jay Jugwanth and attorney Surendra Singh in 2016 at the Mountain Rise Police Station. Jugwanth said on Monday he was very happy that a policeman was found guilty for assaulting a civilian. “Too often policemen get away because civilians do not exercise their rights to charge them,” he said. Jugwanth added he was disappointed that as chairperson of the CPF, he was not afforded any protection by the policemen in the charge office who witnessed the assault. Jugwanth said that as he had no faith in all the local police stations, he had to turn to the Independent Police Investigative Directorate to probe the case. He was impressed with the work done by Warrant Officer Michael Viljoen who “drove the case” along with a senior prosecutor. At the time, The Witness reported that Jugwanth was punched in the face by an on-duty police officer in the Community Service Centre (CSC) while he was assisting Singh. Jugwanth said he was called to the station by Singh because he was “disappointed” at the treatment he was getting from police officers at the station. He noticed a captain shouting at Singh above his voice and intervened. Singh was querying information on a court order regarding one of his clients. Jugwanth said the captain refused to release any details, saying they should wait for his supervisor to come to the station. Later, Inderjeeth came and punched him in the face for no reason. When Singh intervened he too was assaulted.
