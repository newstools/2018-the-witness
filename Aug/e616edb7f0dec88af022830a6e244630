Private investigator Brad Nathanson has been accused of assaulting a woman and her former fiancé. Nathanson (55) and his colleague, Shane Brits (27), are facing two charges of assault with intent to do grievous bodily harm relating to an incident last year at the home of Bernice Rich and Glen Galley in Cliffdale. Nathanson had allegedly accosted the couple when he was assisting the police in attempting to arrest Galley for alleged theft. Galley never went to court for the theft accusation. Rich sustained several bruises on her face and a swollen eye. Galley had a swollen ankle and required medical treatment. Nathanson and Brits made a brief appearance at the Mpumalanga Magistrate’s Court in Hammarsdale on Monday. The matter had been set down for a two-day trial, but was postponed. According to the charge sheet, they had slapped, pushed and punched Rich, and had punched Galley and stomped on his foot. The matter was postponed to next month because the state had decided to release one of its witnesses, Warrant Officer Chettiah, who was one of the officers who attended the incident in question. The matter has now been set down for a three-day trial, and both Galley and Rich are expected to testify as state witnesses. Nathanson hit headlines this year through his involvement in the case of a murdered Durban woman, Siam Lee. Lee’s body was found in a sugarcane field in the New Hanover area. Nathanson assisted police in apprehending a Durban businessman, who is currently before court facing a raft of charges, including rape. During his bail application, the accused in that case alleged that Nathanson and his colleagues had behaved violently toward him, including punching and choking him, and had allegedly searched his property without permission.
