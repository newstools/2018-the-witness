Young Pietermaritzburg runner Ndumiso Sokhela was thrilled with his marathon debut in Sunday’s seventh Mandela Day Marathon which was dominated by East African athletes. Running in the colours of Arthur Ford Athletics Club, the extremely enthusiastic KwaCaluza-born entrant crossed the finish line in a surprisingly good ninth place at the Nelson Mandela Capture Site in Howick, where the late international icon was arrested on August 5, 1962. Sokhela came home in two hours, 33 minutes and 25 seconds, with Sintayehu Yinesu of Ethiopia winning this standard 42,2 km marathon in 2:28,05. Sokhela trains with three-time Comrades Marathon winner Bongmusa Mthembu, who was also at the historic event on Sunday, giving support to the thousands of runners taking part. The 23-year-old Sokhela would have been a lot closer to fellow provincial runner Syabonga Nkonde, who was the first South African man home in taking fifth place in 2:32,28, had it not been for minor cramping in the final kilometres. Nonetheless, he was proud of his performance and credited his senior teammates and coach Xolani Mabhida, who helped him along the undulating route of the race that started at 6 am at Manaye Hall in Edendale. That was where Madiba made his last public speech before being detained, at the All-In-Africa conference on March 25, 1961. “I’m very happy with how I did today. I knew I’d finish in the top 10 because of the way I trained. “It was my first marathon and I think my team came through big for me,’’ said a beaming but visibly tired Sokhela. Overall, Nedbank athletes dominated, with Ethiopian Yinesu winning on his first attempt. Yinesu was followed by team-mate Mabuthile Lebopo from Lesotho in 2:29,11 and Kenya’s Mark Oyugu in 2:31,03. After the event, which had one of the largest fields ever seen in the country, Sokhela said he hoped to get better from here on. “I’m very fortunate to have guys such as Mthembu in my team, who most athletes look up to. I learn a lot from them and they all kept telling me to keep going. I know I can only get better from here on,’’ he said. Meanwhile, Kenyan Loice Jebet won the women’s section of the race and Ethiopia’s Selom Alebachew came second in 2:53,21. Makhosi Mhlongo from Boxer Athletics Club was the first South African and KwaZulu-Natal woman home, in fourth place in 3:04,07. Hammarsdale’s Ntokozo Mkhize, also from Arthur Ford Athletics club, finished seventh in 3:19,22 in a hard-fought battle. She said parts of the race had been quite challenging. “This was the toughest marathon I’ve ever run, the hills. I think about five kilometres before the finish, I was giving up and I would have finished somewhere in the top four had I not stopped. But luckily my team-mates came and told me to keep going,’’ she said. This year’s event, which is one of the Comrades Marathon qualifying races, was run in particular celebration of Mandela’s centenary year.  SELECTED RESULTS OPEN MEN 42,2 km: 1.
