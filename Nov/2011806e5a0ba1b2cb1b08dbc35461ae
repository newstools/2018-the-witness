Pietermaritzburg’s CBD erupted in chaos on Friday morning
when taxi operators allegedly began burning the belongings of vagrants in the
area. Taxi operators allegedly accused vagrants of committing
crimes in town and within the taxi ranks. A Safe City employee, who asked not to be named, said they
watched the mayhem unfold through the Safe City CCTV cameras. The source said a group of people, believed to be taxi
operators from the Retief Street taxi rank, started burning the vagrants’
belongings on the road at around 9 am on Friday. “The vagrants moved to the vacant land across from the taxi
rank but the municipal security came and moved them,” said the source. “The
vagrants started moving downtown and the police and municipal security were
following them around.” South African National Taxi Council (Santaco) uMgungundlovu
region chairperson Bheki Sokhela told Weekend Witness that he had not heard
about the incident and could not comment. However, he said the taxi industry has complained about the
vagrants at the Retief Street rank. “The public cannot use the toilets at that
rank as there are groups of vagrants gathered there day and night,” he said. “Commuters resort to urinating around the rank in fear of
being mugged by those vagrants.” Sokhela said the council had raised the issue with the
municipality, as well as the fact that there is a tavern inside the rank, which
also causes chaos. “We as Santaco are against our taxi ranks being misused by
troublemakers. People are now scared to go to taxi ranks because of crime and
that affects business. The KZN police media centre did not respond to an inquiry
sent to them about the incidents.
