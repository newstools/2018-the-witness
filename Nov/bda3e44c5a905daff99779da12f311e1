Police diving units and search and rescue teams from across the province have been at Midmar Dam for training since Wednesday. The teams used the Midmar Yacht Club as their base during training. The Durban University of Technology search and rescue/diving team also took part in the training. Police divers and some of the student divers, spent most of Thursday recovering a vessel that had sunk a year ago. Equipped with all their diving gear, the divers had to swim 24 metres down to reach the vessel. Police said recovering the boat was a precarious operation that also depended on the weather. Divers had tried on Wednesday to recover the boat but due to the wind and bad weather, they were unable to dive. The Midmar Yacht Club’s Mike Coldbeck said the teams wanted to recover the boat as part of their training. “We told them about the boat that sunk a year ago and they said they would recover it as part of their training. “The vessel belonged to the Durban Sea Scouts, who mostly come from disadvantaged backgrounds. “They had the boat for just a month before it sunk. Everyone has been in a good mood and everything is being done so professionally,” said Coldbeck. The vessel was eventually recovered later in the afternoon by members of various search and rescue and diving teams, including in Pietermaritzburg, Durban, Ladysmith and Port Shepstone.
