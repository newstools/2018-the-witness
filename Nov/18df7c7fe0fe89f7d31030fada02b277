A man was gunned down in a hail of AK47 bullets in a suspected taxi-related hit on the R33 near Pietermaritzburg early on Monday morning. Police found the man in the passenger side of a perfectly-parked silver Toyota, slumped over onto the passenger window, his body riddled with bullets. Police are now on the hunt for the driver of the vehicle, who was not at the scene when they arrived, and the AK47 wielding suspects. Over 30 rounds of ammunition are believed to have been fired at the man through the driver’s side of the car. It is thought that the driver’s door was open when the attackers fired into the car, causing large exit holes in the passenger door. The windscreen had also been shot several times. A source, who asked not to be named, said a man who had witnessed the attack from a distance said they had seen a car pull up next to the parked Toyota. “He said he heard lots of gunshots and then the car sped off.” With the driver of the vehicle missing, the Pietermaritzburg Search and Rescue and the K9 Unit combed the grassy land next to the road in the hopes of finding a trail, however, nothing was found.   A source added that a revolver was found in the back of the Toyota. Police and traffic police blocked off the roads to the scene while forensics dusted the vehicle for fingerprints and any other evidence. Yellow markers, to mark where the spent bullets had fallen, littered the ground in front of the car and the passenger side of the vehicle. Another source added that the man appeared to have been shot at close range. The source added that the car was found to belong to a Durban man and had the correct registration plates and had not been not stolen. “That man was ambushed. It was a proper hit,” said the source. Provincial police spokesperson Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said on Monday afternoon that the man had still not been identified but he was believed to be in his 30s. He said the shooting occurred at 4.30 am on Monday morning.
