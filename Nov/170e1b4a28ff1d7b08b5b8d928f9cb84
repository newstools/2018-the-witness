With matric exams nearing the end, some Haythorne Secondary pupils reported their delight at how exams have been going, saying Zulu was the easiest paper. Amanda Nene, Thandolethu Mkhize, Nosihle Mkhize, Luyanda Ndaba and Ayanda Dladla were speaking to The Witness on Tuesday after their Zulu paper three exam. “It was super easy. I even finished well before time,” said Thandolethu. Dladla said the only exams that were difficult were life sciences paper one, maths paper one and engineering graphics and design paper two. The pupils said while they were relieved that they would no longer be in high school, they were also anxious about leaving home. “I am extremely excited that I will no longer be waking up early in the morning daily to iron [my uniform] and polish my school shoes,” said Dladla. “I’m happy that I’m going to university, but I do think it will be difficult to adapt to the new life,” said Ndaba. “I’m honestly going to miss my mom. She’s everything to me,” said Thandolethu. Nosihle said she found the process of writing more stressful now than before she started writing. “I’m constantly having anxiety attacks because every paper that I write, I’m stressing about whether I answered the questions correctly and what my results will look like,” she said. “Having to live up to your family’s expectations made everything more stressful.” “Family telling you that you’re their only hope and that you should do better than them in life, is also stressful on its own,” said Dladla. Despite family pressures, the pupils were all cheered up about not having to do any chores during exams and planned to enjoy some time with friends before the New Year.
