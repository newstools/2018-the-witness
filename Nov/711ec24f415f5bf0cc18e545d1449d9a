Friday marked the end of week three of the matric year-end exams. ML Sultan Secondary School matrics were among those who sat down to write their Life Sciences paper one exam on Friday. Speaking to The Witness, Lungelo Khuzwayo, Frank Shangase and Sibusisiwe Khumalo agreed that the Life Sciences paper was challenging, but manageable. “It wasn’t a difficult paper. I can say it was better than trials,” said Shangase. “The questions were fair and the paper was structured according to what we learned in the syllabus; there was nothing new,” said Khuzwayo. The trio said since it was exam time, they were very happy to have received special treatment at home. “I have been allowed to come home later than usual because of study classes and extra lessons,” said Shangase. “I have been excused from doing house chores, and that makes me very happy,” said Khumalo. All four pupils said they were excited to be going to university, but had mixed feelings about leaving home. “I have applied to do an LLB degree at Howard [College] and I cannot wait to get away from home; I feel like this is the time to learn to be independent and responsible,” said Shangase. “I have applied to do a Civil Engineering course at the University of Cape Town, and I am terrified, but I’m ready for a new chapter,” said Khuzwayo. Speaking about the best time to study, Khumalo said her best time was early in the morning. “From there, I do not go to sleep again because I am energised. I just shower and go write my exam,” she said. The pupils said God got them through the exams. “Start studying early and pray,” they said.
