Police are frantically searching for an 11-year-old Copesville boy who they fear was kidnapped while walking to school on Friday morning. Andile Fihla was walking to Msilinga Primary School with his sister in the Copesville area on Friday when a man known to the boy and his friend, stopped him on the road “to talk to him”. Mountain Rise Police spokesperson Captain Gay Ebrahim said the man then told Andile’s sister to go to school and said that Andile would catch up with her. “A resident saw that the man had stopped Andile and phoned the child’s mother to tell her what she had seen. The mother then called the school to find out if Andile was in class but the school said he did not arrive that morning.” Ebrahim said the mother then realised that the man who had been talking to her son may have kidnapped him and she immediately reported the matter to police. The mother also told police that on Thursday last week, she was walking in the Swapo area when the same man thought to have kidnapped her son, started beating her with a stick. The beating left the mother with a fractured arm and bruises to the rest of her body. “Whilst assaulting the mother he told her to stop interfering in his relationship. He then ran away.” Ebrahim said a case of assault was opened. “Police are urgently seeking information regarding the whereabouts of Andile Fihla, as well as the person who is wanted for questioning in the kidnapping case.” On Tuesday, various police units including search-and-rescue, Mountain Rise detectives and FSC members searched for Andile in an area within Copesville. However, he is still nowhere to be found. “The Pietermaritzburg FSC Unit is appealing to the community for information regarding Andile, to ensure his safe return,” said Ebrahim. Anyone with information can contact the investigating officer Detective Sergeant Ntombela at 083 939 8853.
