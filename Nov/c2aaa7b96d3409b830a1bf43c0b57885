Good for some but not for others. This was the mixed reaction of matric pupils at Northbury Park Secondary School after writing their Business Studies exam on Thursday. Speaking to The Witness, Thandeka Zulu said though there were some challenging questions, the paper was good. “I think the paper was better than the other papers I have written,” she said. Meanwhile, Mfundo Dlamini, Wiseman Khumalo and Ntuthuko Dlamini said the paper was very challenging. “Just like Accounting, this paper was very difficult, it was bad,” said Khumalo. The pupils said that they felt slightly overwhelmed in the lead-up to the exams, but the actual process of writing was less stressful than they had imagined. “I was stressed because of the pressure I got from people constantly telling me to study hard and how this was my make or break moment,” said Khumalo. “The stress came from the anticipation of what we thought would come out and what we would be required to do; and we also didn’t know what to expect,” said Ntuthuko. While Khumalo and Ntuthuko said they were going to relax and enjoy their holidays, Mfundo and Zulu said they were getting themselves part-time jobs after their final exam. “I believe I should do something productive with my time, and getting a job and money is the best option,” said Zulu. All four pupils said they were excited to be going to university, but had different reactions when it came to leaving home. “I’m honestly scared of going out there; it’s going to be challenging living a life with no one to guide me,” said Mfundo. “Even though there will be responsibilities and challenges, I am ready for my freedom,” said Khumalo. Speaking about what got them through the exam, Zulu said: “Trusting in God and myself.”
