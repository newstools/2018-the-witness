A Western Cape man, cycling across the country to raise funds for children’s homes, made a stop at the Pietermaritzburg Royal Showgrounds on Thursday. Janco Lehmann (25), a former gym teacher at Hoërskool Paarl Gimnasium in the Cape, quit his job to embark on the selfless journey under the banner of his organisation Gee Hoop (Give Hope) to donate to orphanages across the country. His 1 793 km journey began on October 3 at Alexander Bay in the Cape and will end at Durban’s King’s Park Stadium on Friday next week. He has travelled through the Western Cape, Northern Cape, Free State and KwaZulu-Natal, stopping to visit local orphanages. Lehmann said his journey has been “wonderful”. “The people have been great and supportive throughout my journey.” He said the idea to embark on his journey came to him three years ago. “I told my best friend Armand Od­en­daal about it and his first response was ‘When do we start?’ “A month later he passed away in a motorbike accident. It’s been three years since his death so this journey is also a commemoration of his memory.” Lehmann said he was not a cyclist and before embarking on his solo trip, he underwent a week’s training. “The first week was tough but after that it’s been easier despite some minor obstacles. Besides that, it’s been an amazing experience and I wouldn’t mind doing it again,” he said. Lehmann said the generous people in the towns he has cycled through have offered him shelter and food throughout his journey. “I have a tent with me but fortunately I haven’t used it because everyone has been so amazing. “Thank you to everyone who has been supporting my journey ...” Referring to the Japanese cyclist, Tetsuya Mizoguchi, who was robbed at gunpoint in Howick, Lehmann said crime has never been a concern for him as he has never felt unsafe during his journey. Lehmann will be spending a few days in the city visiting local orphanages to give motivational talks. To follow his journey visit his Facebook page Gee Hoop.
