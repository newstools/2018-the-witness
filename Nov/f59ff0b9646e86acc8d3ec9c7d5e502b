The two-week search for Andile Fihla (11), who was kidnapped on November 9, ended tragically when police discovered the boy’s body on Tuesday night. The body was found a mere 500 metres from a dam in the Copesville area where police had focused their search for the missing child only last week. A man, who is allegedly known to the boy’s family, is expected to appear in court today in connection with the murder. The search began after Andile was reported missing on November 9. Since then police have conducted an extensive search using police tracker dogs to try and trace the boy and his abductor. Last week, police received information that the boy may have been seen near a dam in Copesville. Members of the Pietermaritzburg SAPS Diving Unit, detective branch and the Umhlali K9 Unit searched the bush and the heavily-polluted dam for the best part of the day to no avail. A break in the case came when the alleged kidnapper (28) handed himself over to police on Tuesday afternoon at the Pieter­maritzburg police station. The man agreed to point out where he had left Andile’s body and police resumed their hunt for the body despite the heavy rain, strong wind and lightning. Police subsequently found Andile’s decapitated body in the bush around Northdale, about 500 metres from the dam they had searched a week earlier, sources told The Witness. Various police sources who asked not to be named said they were devastated by the case and had hoped, against all odds, that Andile might be found alive. One source said that several officers who worked on the case had requested counselling as the discovery of the body was “a devastating blow” to those involved.
