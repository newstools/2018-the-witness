Matriculants at St Anne’s Diocesan College feared the worst when going in to write their maths paper two exam on Monday, but it turned out to be much better than expected. The pupils’ fear stemmed from their first maths paper having been very difficult on Friday, so they said they were very relieved when paper two was not as hard yesterday. They told The Witness that they now had a better chance of passing the subject with a decent mark. “At least with this paper, the things we learned in class were actually in the exam, unlike paper one where you didn’t even know where to start,” said Sande Stephen. “I can confidently say there is a possibility of passing with a B in this paper,” said Ashleigh Moss. The pupils admitted that the process of writing was less stressful than they had imagined. “There is just so much pressure about the final exams that you realise it is not as bad as you thought it would be when you’re writing the exams,” said Tayla Blacklaw. “I was overwhelmed before writing, but I actually feel more relaxed now that I am writing then before we started writing,” said Caitlin Scott. Speaking about changing bad habits, Stephen and Moss said they were guilty of a few bad habits, but they have since adapted everything to fit their study schedule. Stephen said: “I use my phone less now.” Moss said she used to study the day before, but has since had to change that habit. While Scott and Moss said they would be attending the Rage Festival after their exams, Blacklaw said she would be at home in Ballito and Stephen said she was headed to Mauritius with friends. The pupils said their parents would be the first people they were going to share their results with.
