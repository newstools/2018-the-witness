Azalea Bed & Breakfast in Howick won the national award in the three- star B&B category. Beverley Country Cottages in Dargle won the three-star self catering exclusive category. Hawklee Country House in Nottingham Road won the three-star country house category. Dubbed the “Oscars” of the industry, 80% of the judges’ score for the awards, made over the weekend, was based on consumer reviews. Reviews taken into consideration were from the Lilizela Awards website as well as Trip­Advisor.
