Two months after making the horror discovery that their 17-year-old relative had been left unclaimed for a month at a mortuary, a Northdale couple have been charged with assaulting and kidnapping a man. Mxolisi Innocent Zuma (34), his wife Zama Buthelezi Zuma (30) and her brother Msizi Buthelezi (28) are facing charges of housebreaking with the intent to assault, assault with intent to do grievous bodily harm, and kidnapping. According to the charge sheet, the three had allegedly broken into Thobani Brightman Zondi’s Northdale home on Naka Road on September 9. Zama and Msizi’s sister, Sanelisiwe (17), went missing on August 5. Her body was found by her family a month later at Northdale mortuary on September 7, where it had been for more than a month. The Witness interviewed Mxolisi and Zama about finding Sanelisiwe’s body at the mortuary on the same day the alleged incident took place. The three made their first appearance at the Pietermaritzburg Magistrate’s Court on Wednesday, and will appear again later this month for a bail application. They had allegedly hit Zondi with their fists, sjamboks and sticks and poured cold water on him. They face one count of housebreaking with the intent to assault and assault with intent to do grievous bodily harm, two counts of assault with intent to do grievous bodily harm and three counts of kidnapping Zondi. Sanelisiwe lived with Mxolisi and Zama, and would sometimes live with Msizi. She had not been regularly attending school because of a mental disorder. She was last seen on Ghandi Road in Northdale. The Witness reported in September that the family was told by a person in the Woodlands area that they had seen Sanelisiwe being assaulted on the day of her disappearance and that she was taken off in an ambulance. That made the family search hospitals for her, and they eventually found her at the Northdale mortuary “already decomposing”. She was raised by Zama after her parents died when she was very young.
