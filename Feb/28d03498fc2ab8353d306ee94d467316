 After the resignation of South African President Jacob Zuma on Wednesday, Witness reporter Vuyelwa Mtolo took to the streets and asked people what they thought about it. This is what some of them had to say.   PRISCILLA CLARKE (63) Scottsville: “This is very good news. Zuma did the right thing by stepping down before he was removed from his seat as president. He has been accused of stealing money from the country, making us poverty stricken. He’s got away with it.”  RYAN LANDSMAN (23) Durban: “This is great news. If you have skills to run the country, you have my full support. I don’t know Cyril Ramaphosa personally, but if he does a good job and things become better for SA, then he has my full support.”  GALLINA NGUBANE (77) Sweetwaters: “Zuma should have finished his term. It pains me because he has helped so many children and the children liked him too.”  VUMANI MDLALOSE (32) Imbali Unit BB: “This was Zuma’s last year anyway; I didn’t see the need for him to resign. People should have allowed him to finish his term in office.”  VIJAY DEVCHARRAM (57) Raisethorpe: “I am very happy that Zuma resigned. We need to move forward as a country and eradicate corruption. Things will be different now with Cyril Ramaphosa as president, I have confidence in him.”  NANDI HADEBE (21) Durban: “Personally I don’t like Zuma and I never have. He’s accused of using taxpayers’ money for his own benefit ... look at Nkandla. It is great that he has finally resigned, it’s about time. I would appreciate anyone else as president but Zuma.”
