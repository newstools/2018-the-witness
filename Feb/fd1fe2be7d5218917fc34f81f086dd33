With pressure mounting on National First Division side Royal
Eagles as they bid to avoid relegation, coach Kosta Papic has dismissed rumours
that he has been shown the door following yet another disappointing result at
the weekend. The Pietermaritzburg side succumbed to their fourth loss
since the Serbian mentor took charge in December — losing 4-0 to league leaders
Highlands Park on Saturday. They have endured a disastrous campaign this season,
recording four wins out of 20 games and sitting 14th in the standings. A report on Tuesday suggested that 57-year-old tactician
Papic had been relieved of his duties and that Roger Skhakhane would be in
charge of this coming Saturday’s Nedbank Cup last-32 match against Happy
Wanderers. Sikhakhane recently returned to Chippa United in Port
Elizabeth as the club’s technical advisor and assistant to head coach Teboho
Moloi. Said Papic: “I’m still in charge of the team. I don’t know
where those claims come from. I’ve only just been hired. We have 10 games left
that we need to worry about — and we need at least four wins from them to
survive. So that’s our concern for now.” Papic, who is being assisted by compatriot Vladislav Heric,
has registered three wins, four losses and one draw since December. Eagles have not had stability in the coaching department
this season, having been coached by Allan Freese and Zipho Dlangalala prior to
Papic’s arrival.
