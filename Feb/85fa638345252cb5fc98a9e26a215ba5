FIVE households on Dresda Road in Northdale had all their 
appliances blown out by an apparent electrical surge last Tuesday. Now the residents — all of whom are pensioners — say they will have 
to wait as long as six months for the Msunduzi Municipality to say whether the 
City will foot the bill for the damage.
