Residents from all over Msunduzi are expected to come out in their numbers on Monday to join a service delivery and anti-corruption march to the City Hall. Organisers said the march was open to everyone, even though it is organised by two ANC councillors together with the ruling party’s tripartite alliance partners in Pietermaritzburg. “It is not a political march. We are saying all concerned residents of Msunduzi must come and join hands with us as we demand accountability from those in the local government,” said Cosatu’s Zimasile Giyama. Msunduzi has granted the organisers the necessary permission for the gathering. Giyama said they wanted to ensure it was legal so that people can see they are doing everything by the book. ANC councillor Mtuza Mkhize said the march is part of a three-month campaign to force the ANC’s national executive to act against those who have failed the people of Msunduzi. Mkhize is also a member of the ANC regional executive. He said they are disgusted by the blatant corruption and the total disregard of the City’s service delivery commitments to its residents. Their objective is to get criminal charges brought against those involved in defrauding the municipality and for the MEC for Co-operative Governance and Traditional Affairs, Nomusa Dube-Ncube, to place the municipality under administration. “The recent disclaimer from the Auditor-General’s office is an indication that we have hit rock bottom. We can’t sink any deeper. “The only way we can recover from this is if Cogta takes over the executive powers because the people who are tasked with making decisions are failing the people of Msunduzi,” said Mkhize. Mayor Themba Njilo is expected to receive the memorandum on behalf of the City. Route of the march The march will depart from Dales Park at 11 am. The affected roads will be Hoosen Haffejee, West, Langalibalele and Chief Albert Luthuli streets. It is expected to be over by 3 pm.
