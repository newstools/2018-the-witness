Midmar Mile race director Wayne Riddin says that except for water levels that keep rising at Midmar Dam, all is set for the world’s largest open water swimming event this coming weekend. The 45th edition of the annual race will take place on Saturday and Sunday. Riddin said the city was ready to welcome scores of swimmers and spectators to the prestigious event. He said this year’s event had drawn increased interest from swimmers around the globe, and the number of entries had gone up from last year. “We are set for the event but the big issue is that we have a problem with the water that is rising by the metre. So we now have to readjust because we didn’t expect that and now we putting everything back to where it used to be, at a 100% level,” said Riddin. “Once that’s done, we will be waiting for people to come down wherever they come from. “We are glad that we have had 600 more entries than we had last year, so we are happy and hoping that we will get more,” he said. “We have got at least 11 338 entries at the moment and we normally get about 1 800 late entries, but it still depends on the weather though; if we have a rainy weekend people might decide to stay home.” Last year’s winner in the men’s section, Matthew Meyer, has confirmed that he won’t be out to defend his title after he beat the seven-time winner of the race, Chad Ho. “The defending lady, Ashley Twitchell, the American, is coming back to defend her title. “Amongst the men, Matthew Meyer who won the race last year beating Chad Ho and stopping him from getting his eighth title, is not swimming anymore. So with him retiring he won’t defend the title and Chad Ho now has the chance to take his eighth title,” said Riddin. A group of Canadian swimmers were already in the country to take part in the race for the first time, added an excited Riddin.
