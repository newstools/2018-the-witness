A fire at the Life Hilton Hospital on Saturday morning led to 17 Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients being evacuated to other hospitals in Pietermaritzburg and Durban. Life Healthcare said in a statement on Sunday that no patients or staff were at risk following the fire. It broke out in the early hours of Saturday morning at the hospital’s main electrical distribution board near the renal unit. Life Healthcare spokesperson Tanya Bennetts said the fire resulted in a temporary “total loss of power supply to the facility”. “Patient, doctor and employee safety is not at risk and there have been no injuries or casualties as a result of this fire,” said Bennetts. However, the fire had “compromised electrical supply to the ICU and in the interests of patient safety” the hospital made the decision to transfer 17 of them. They were transported to hospitals in Pietermaritzburg and Durban. “We continue to monitor the progress of the patients that were transferred and their families have been notified of their move,” she said. Bennetts added that because of the partial destruction of the hospital’s distribution board its generators have not been able to provide power. However, electrical engineers had been able to feed a limited power supply into the facility from a generator housed in the oncology bunker. Bennetts said the “essential” electrical supply should be restored yesterday and a new distribution board should be operational early this week.
