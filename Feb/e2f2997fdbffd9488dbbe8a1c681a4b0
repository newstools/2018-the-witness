Scottsville residents have complained of “shoddy workmanship” by Msunduzi Municipality workers, after a road in the area was reduced to a dangerous single lane following repairs to a water pipe beneath it. In December workers responded to complaints about a water leak at the corner of Chapman and Roseveare roads, residents said. They said the leak was fixed, but workers failed to seal the surface properly. Now part of the road is totally unusable. The municipal workers filled the part of the road they had dug up with rubble, stuck a stick into the ground and tied a white plastic packet to it as a warning to motorists. “I’ve tried to e-mail the municipality, but the e-mail address listed on its website bounced back,” a resident told The Witness. “This is a small, narrow street and it is dangerous because cars turning in and out of it only really have one lane to use. An accident could easily happen. We’re just lucky the road is quiet.” The resident added: “We appreciate they’ve fixed the burst pipe, but they never tidied it up. It’s almost two months now and it’s disappointing. It’s dangerous and it just makes the road look a mess.” Msunduzi spokesperson Thobeka Mafumbatha said a foreman would be sent to “investigate the matter” and attend to it. Shoddy repair work by municipal workers has been highlighted in The Witness before. Last year, it was reported that workers fixed a water pipe outside a business premises but left the surface unsealed, causing the tyres of at least two vehicles to burst.
