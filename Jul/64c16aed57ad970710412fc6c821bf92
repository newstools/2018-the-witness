A cheeky burglar broke into a Chase Valley house on Tuesday, and made himself comfortable by helping himself to food, drink and the homeowner’s toothbrush. Pietermaritzburg police spokesperson Sergeant Mthokozisi Ngobese said the burglar did not appear to have stolen anything, but did leave the house in “quite a mess”. Neighbours who had been keeping an eye on the house while the owner was away found the home had been broken into only on Tuesday morning. When they entered the house, they found the burglar had pulled all the contents of the cupboards in the house out onto the floor before making himself comfortable on the couch in the lounge. The intruder then switched on the television in the lounge and helped himself to a two-litre Coke and a pizza before heading to the bathroom to clean himself up. The neighbours found the television still blaring, the empty Coke bottle and pizza box in the lounge and a sink filled with water, with a toothpaste tube open and lying on the edge of the bathroom basin. The burglar also left his charging cable behind and it is thought the man even had a nap as items not belonging to the homeowner were found on the bedside table in one of the rooms. “This is a very unique and unusual case,” said Ngobese
