A policeman who was arrested after the shooting of a cab
driver on Wednesday night has been granted R1 000 bail. Constable Busisa Gift Bhengu (31), a member of the
Pietermaritzburg Rapid Response Unit, has only been charged with the pointing
of a firearm — at Mustata Spoon — in the city centre. The prosecutor, Patty David, told the city’s magistrate’s
court on Friday that at this stage it is unknown why he pointed his gun at the
man. She said the state has no reason to oppose Bhengu being
granted bail. “The investigating officer says that he has a fixed address,
he is not a flight risk and has no previous or pending cases,” said David. Bhengu’s attorney said he was employed as a policeman for 13
years and has two young children. He lives with his unemployed mother, who he
also supports financially. The Witness has reported that the policeman is being
investigated by the Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid) for the
murder of the cab driver, Luleka Zulu (29). His brother, Sizwe Zulu, said: “This is all confusing to the
family. The investigating officer told us bail is going to be opposed.” He and his siblings said the court considered that Bhengu
was a father but was not even told that his brother leaves behind his
four-year-old child who has not yet been told that his father was killed. Bonginkosi Zulu described him as being an innocent person
who was never violent. “He liked peace. He liked the company of other people
... why was my brother shot?” He added that justice must take its course. Ipid spokesperson Moses Dlamini said that while they are
investigating Bhengu for Zulu’s murder, at this stage there appears to be no
evidence linking him to the murder. No eye witnesses were willing to give a
statement. Bhengu’s case was adjourned to August 20.
