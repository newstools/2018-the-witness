Umgeni Water is lifting its water restrictions with immediate effect, as water levels in the Mgeni System dams have reached 72%. Three years ago, Umgeni Water implemented water restrictions of 15% in a bid to conserve water due to the province’s crippling drought. Spokesperson Shami Harichunder said last week the Mgeni System had reached 69% and needed just one more percent to lift the water restrictions. He had predicted the restrictions would be lifted by the end of May, however, due to the rain over the weekend, the Mgeni System went up a whole three percent. The Joint Operations Committee for the Mgeni system, comprising Umgeni Water, Department of Water and Sanitation, Msunduzi Local Municipality, uMgungundlovu District Municipality, eThekwini Metro and the KwaZulu-Natal Department of Co-operative Governance and Traditional Affairs, met again on Monday to discuss the water situation. Harichunder said although the restrictions have been gazetted and they would have to apply to have them removed, Umgeni Water are removing the restrictions “with immediate effect”. “The conservation of water is still required, but there is no longer a need for restrictions.” Harichunder said with the system at 72%, they would be able to meet the full demands of their customers
