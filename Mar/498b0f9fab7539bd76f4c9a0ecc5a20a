The 15 people embroiled in the alleged issuing of fraudulent learner’s licences at the uMngeni Licensing Office in Howick were all released on bail after appearing at the Durban Commercial Crimes Court on Wednesday. Five officials from the licensing office, including two traffic officers, nine learner’s licence applicants, and a cleaner, were arrested on Tuesday during a joint operation by the Road Traffic Management Corporation’s (RTMC) National Traffic Anti-Corruption Unit, the Hawks and the KwaZulu-Natal Traffic Department. The investigations revealed that the applicants were allegedly paying R2 300 to obtain their learner’s licences. It was alleged that when the applicants got into the exam rooms they were assisted by examiners using lasers to pass the exam. All 15 suspects were granted bail of R1 000 each and the case was adjourned to April 19, 2018. The six accused licensing office employees are: Lindiwe Xulu, Meshack Ndlovu, Nkosinathi Zondi, Dumisani Nkula, Nelisiwe Dladla and Waheeda Essop Mansoor. The nine learner’s licence applicants are Mboyi Zondi, Alex Nzama, Melusi Dlamini, Nhlanhla Zondi, Zolile Nzimande, Nokukhanya Gcabashe, Nobuhle Mbali, Siyabonga Mlotshwa and Makhosi Mbokazi. Simon Zwane, spokesperson for RTMC, said the accused were all aged between 22 to 54 years old. Hawks are still searching for another senior staff member who was not at work when the other arrests were made.
