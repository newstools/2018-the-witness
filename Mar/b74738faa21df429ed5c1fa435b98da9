MK veterans who have occupied flats in the Aloe Ridge council housing complex refuse to leave despite an eviction order. On Friday, the Pietermaritzburg high court granted an application brought by the development’s owner, Capital Housing NPC, to have about 200 Mkhonto weSizwe Military Veterans Association (MKVA) members evicted. Last week they overpowered security at Aloe Ridge and began occupying flats. The KwaZulu-Natal structure of the MKVA visited the site on Friday to assess the situation. Themba Mavundla, the chairperson of the MKVA in KZN, said veterans would not leave Aloe Ridge. “They said they are not going anywhere, and we are appealing to Capital City to be sensitive and cautious when dealing with them as there could be unintended consequences. “I don’t know how they would respond if forced out … there could be chaos,” he told The Witness. Mavundla explained that veterans had taken the decision because of years of getting the runaround from municipalities regarding sites to build houses. “MKVA and [the Department of] Human Settlements years ago put aside money to build homes for veterans. But the problem is municipalities don’t want to release sites to build on. “Sometimes there are other problems like MKVA have their own construction companies and want to be involved, but municipalities want their own people to build it. “We were constantly being given the run-around on the availability of sites, while veterans remained homeless. You get veterans who are 50, 60, 70 years old still living with their mothers.” He said the action taken by veterans would hopefully pressure the government to fast-track housing developments for them. He also said that opportunists not part of the MKVA had demanded keys to Aloe Ridge units. He said keys would be recovered from them and they would be removed.
