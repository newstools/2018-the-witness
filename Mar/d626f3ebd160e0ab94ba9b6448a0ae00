Vagrants have taken occupation of yet another vacant plot of land on a residential road in Northdale — this time in Sheba Road. Residents said vagrants could be seen sleeping in the dense undergrowth and hanging their clothes on the bushes. A resident of 12 years, who lives close to the plot, said residents have become afraid that opportunistic crime may escalate in the area. “We used to pool money and get the bush cut, but then it stopped about a year ago because it became too expensive,” a resident said. “We have complained to our ward councillor and the municipality. They came to have a look at it a few months ago but nothing happened.” The plot in question is a sizable piece of land with a thick overgrowth, which even overlaps on the road. INCOMPLETE WORK Residents have complained that Msunduzi workers have not properly sealed yet another road work site. This time, it is for a water pipe repair job at the corner of Dolphin Avenue and Deccan Road, Northdale. A resident said: “Motorists have to swerve to avoid this site, which is like a ditch. “This is a concern because it is a blind-side, and motorists on the other lane can’t see them. “I have sent the City so many photos of this. It’s been a month and nothing has been done.” POWER OUTAGES Lincoln Meade resident Kuben Naidoo said the area has had frequent power outages in recent weeks, several of them lasting hours. “First on Saturday the 17th, it went off for a few hours. Then on the 21st [Human Rights Day] it went off from about 3 pm to 8 pm. We are not given any notice for this, and sometimes we hear that it goes off while we’re at work for about 10-15 minutes.” Msunduzi did not respond to any Witness queries relating to these complaints.
