In a strange twist following the murder last year of the deputy mayor of Richmond, Thandazile Phoswa, her body was exhumed for analysis on Tuesday. Emotional family members, municipal workers as well as a handful of community members, looked on as the body was being exhumed in the Richmond cemetery. It is understood that Phoswa’s remains will be reburied today after a pathology test. Phoswa was found with a gunshot wound to the head almost a year ago. Police opened a murder case after her death and her boyfriend, Samukelo Chili, was arrested. Chili, who worked as a bodyguard in uMshwathi municipality at the time, was the only person with Phoswa when she died. Phoswa’s death, which followed that of municipal manager, Sibusiso Sithole, left Richmond reeling. Community members went on a rampage when it emerged in court a week after Phoswa’s death that Chili had not been charged with her murder. He was charged for contravention of the Firearms Act and failure to lock a firearm in a safe instead. Police spokesperson Captain Nqobile Gwala said Phoswa’s body was exhumed as part of an ongoing investigation by the Provincial Task Team formed to probe political killings in KwaZulu-Natal. “An arrest will be made after the outcome of the analysis,” said Gwala. Phoswa’s uncle, Zachariah Phoswa, declined to comment yesterday, saying the investigation was at a sensitive stage. A source close to the investigation said the Hawks had received new information about the case and an arrest was imminent. “There have been question marks around the pathology report and an application was granted by Pietermaritzburg high court for the body to be exhumed. A new pathology test will be done. The Hawks know what they are doing and I am sure in two weeks’ time they would have made an arrest,” said the source.
