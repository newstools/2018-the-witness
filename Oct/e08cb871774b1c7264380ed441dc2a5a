While the majority of the matric pupils were writing Tourism and Information Technology exams on Thursday, those under the Independent Examinations Board (IEB) were writing history paper one. Matric pupils from St Nicholas Diocesan School, Thuthukile Hadebe, Lindokuhle Zwane, Ayanda Xaba, Fezile Mabizela and Lungisane Mlangeni told The Witness on Thursday they found the paper fair and manageable although there were some complex questions. “The paper required proper preparation, just like any other paper, but our teacher also helped us a lot with the materials he provided such as documentaries,” said Zwane. Social media is a big thing among teenagers, but Mabizela said he did not allow it to distract him from his studies. “I believe it’s all about self control; one just needs to know what you want in life,” he said. While the other pupils emphasised that they will be relaxing and enjoying the festive season, Xaba and Hadebe said they wanted to make money. “Ayanda and I have already found ourselves jobs at the mall, so we will be making money this festive season.” Mlangeni said he will not be relaxing or making money, but immersing himself in a new hobby after exams. “I am buying myself a bass guitar, and then I will start or join a death metal band, because I’m all about the music. “I also study with Nu Metal music playing in the background; it’s fast paced beat increases my heart rate and I find that I do very well in this kind of setup,” he said. These St Nicholas pupils also have their eyes set on studying further next year, and will be going to various universities across the country.
