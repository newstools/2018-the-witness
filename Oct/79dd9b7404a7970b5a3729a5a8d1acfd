Pietermaritzburg Girls’ High School matric pupils, who were among thousands of matrics across the country who wrote their accounting exam on Wednesday, said the paper was much easier than their trial exam. Speaking to The Witness on Wednesday, Thandoluhle Ndlovu, Zinhle Hlela, Brooklyn Goosen, Zanele Dumisa and Rachael Job, all agreed the exam was easier than expected. “The trial exam was very tough, and it challenged us to study even harder for the final exam paper, and that is why we say it was better,” said Goosen. “I also found that past papers really help when you are revising; all matrics should get themselves past exam papers,” said Ndlovu. Dumisa said although she felt prepared for the paper, she found herself under pressure to finish in the allocated time. “Timing is also very important when studying for any exam because you set a pace for yourself and that way you won’t have a problem in the exam venue,” she said. While Ndlovu, Hlela and Dumisa said they were going to study accounting further next year, Job, who is the school’s Dux, said she was headed to Stellenbosch to study actuarial science and Goosen said she was going to study dental therapy. Speaking about what got them through the exam, Hlela said: “Trusting in God and myself.” All five pupils said their families were very supportive, but they felt pressured to do better and not disappoint anyone. “Even so, I wouldn’t have it any other way; it’s better to have all the support than none,” said Goosen. Speaking about their plans after exams, they all said they would treat themselves and relax.
