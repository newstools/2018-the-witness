Mystery surrounds the disappearance of a Pietermaritzburg academic who has been missing for six days. Dr Nhlakanipho Mntungwa (34), a former University of KwaZulu-Natal (UKZN) employee, was last seen on October 16 in Durban wearing a blue t-shirt and black pants. His brother, Sandile Mntungwa, said that Nhlakanipho had gone to visit his girlfriend in Durban when he disappeared. “Apparently they were at the beach around 8 pm in the car and he and his girlfriend were taking a nap. When she woke up, Nhlaka was not in the car.” Sandile said that his brother’s girlfriend waited for over an hour, hoping that Nhlakanipho would return, but he did not. “We don’t know what happened because he left his cell phone in the car. He only took his wallet with him.” They reported him missing at South Beach police station and at the Loop Street police station on Monday. The family has also put his picture on social media, urging those who might have seen him to contact the police. Sandile said the family have been left confused after receiving messages that Nhlakanipho had been seen around Pietermaritzburg. Nhlakanipho received his PhD in chemistry in 2014 and worked at UKZN for two years, where he was doing research. KwaZulu-Natal police spokesperson Colonel Thembeka Mbele said they were still investigating the matter.
