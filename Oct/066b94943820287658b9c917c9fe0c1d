Matrics across the country wrote their geography papers one and two exams on Tuesday, with some Marion High School pupils describing paper one as disastrous. Syabulela Mchunu, Anele Sibanyoni, Nokwanda Goge and Phumla Mfusi all sighed when The Witness asked them about their paper one on Tuesday morning. “It felt like I was writing something completely new. It was tough,” said Mchunu. “Each one of us was stronger at one or two sections, but that won’t be enough,” said Sibanyoni. Speaking about the influence of social media on their study timetables, the pupils all agreed that social media made their lives much easier. “We use socal media platforms for various reasons; we watch tutorial videos on YouTube, we share past exam papers on Facebook and WhatsApp and we ask each other exam-related questions on the platforms,” said Goge. “It’s really about balance and knowing what you want to achieve in life,” said Mfusi. Sharing some advice and words of support to matrics at this stressful time, the Marion High pupils said the best thing to do is to keep calm, not panic and not doubt oneself. “The most important thing that we forget when we’re studying is to have a bit of fun. “We forget to have fun because we’re constantly stressed and we end up not achieving what we should; this is our last year in high school so let’s enjoy it before it ends,” said Mchunu. Mfusi quoted a proverb in support of Mchunu’s statement: “All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy,” she said. These Marion High pupils have their eyes set on studying further next year, and will be placed at various universities across the country.
