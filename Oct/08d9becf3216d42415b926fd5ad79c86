Brandon Beukes was a vibrant and popular young man who loved the outdoors, until his life was tragically taken from him in an alleged hit-and-run incident in the early hours of Saturday morning. Beukes (22) was travelling home from Howick to Curry’s Post when his car rolled over near the Curry’s Post turn-off. He got out of the car and walked onto the road — where he was knocked down by a passing vehicle and died on impact. A passenger in Beukes’ car sustained injuries. Police spokesperson Captain Gay Ebrahim confirmed the incident, and said police were investigating a case of culpable homicide. Beukes’ step-sister, Shelley Hagan, told The Witness she received a message in the early hours of Saturday morning that Beukes had died. “We heard that he got out of the car and walked up toward the Curry’s Post turn-off. He must have been disorientated and didn’t realise where he was, then walked onto the road and was hit. He died about 40 metres from the accident scene,” she said. “No one has come forward [to take responsibility] at this point. He survived the accident but then this happened.” Beukes was born and raised in Howick, but lived in Curry’s Post with a friend. He had worked in the anti-rhino poaching field, and had ambitions of joining the military. Known as “Peewee” to his friends and “tortoise” to Hagan, Beukes was described as a friendly person who was known for his famous hugs. “He never had anything bad to say about anyone,” an emotional Hagan said. “He was very smiley, and always tried to pick you up when you were sad. We never saw him being sad or crying. “He would remind people every day how beautiful and special they were. He was an amazing person, really one in a million.” Beukes is survived by his step-sister, his mother Melinda Hagan, stepdad Tom Hagan, and half-sister Bianca van Zyl. A funeral service open to the public will be held in Hayfields on Saturday.
