Don't put away those winter woolies just yet in spite of the recent heatwave. Temperatures are set to plummet again by Wednesday. With most of KwaZulu-Natal experiencing temperatures well into the 30s again on Tuesday, the South African Weather Service has predicted severe thunderstorms across most of the province, with gale-force winds in coastal areas. Pietermaritzburg, Ixopo, Lady­smith, Ulundi, and Newcastle are all expected to reach temperatures above 33 degrees on Tuesday, while only Margate and Durban can expect temperatures in the 20s. A warning from the South African Weather Service said thunderstorms are expected over most parts of the province this afternoon. The warning also stated that gale-force north easterly winds of up to 65 km/h are expected along the coast today and winds reaching up to 70 km/h are expected between Richards Bay and Port Edward. However, on Wednesday the province will experience a massive drop in temperature with areas such as Ixopo, Pietermaritzburg, Underberg, Mooi River, Giant’s Castle and Kokstad experiencing maximum temperatures all below 19 degrees and minimum temperatures all below 13 degrees.
