A Northdale dog is recovering from a gunshot wound to its shoulder after it was shot by its owner’s neighbour on Monday night. It is alleged that the neighbour shot the dog because the Staffordshire Bull Terrier-cross had apparently tried to bite the neighbour. Pietermaritzburg SPCA field officer Thobile Gumede said she was summoned to Comet Place informal settlement in Northdale, and when she arrived she “saw the dog lying in a pool of blood on the floor”. Gumede said: “The owners and community had tried to bandage the dog’s wound while they waited for me to arrive but it did not really help stop the bleeding. The dog wasn’t crying or growling. It was awake and just lying there. It was in shock.” The male dog, named Skhebereshe (B**ch), was taken to the Hilton Vet, where x-rays confirmed it had been shot. “Luckily, the bullet only pierced the skin and did not hit any organs or break any bones,” said Gumede. She took Skhebereshe to the Pietermaritzburg SPCA clinic where it is expected to make a full recovery. The owner, who asked not to be named, said he had called the police and opened a case of animal cruelty against his neighbour. Gumede said it appeared that the cases of animal cruelty in the city are increasing.
