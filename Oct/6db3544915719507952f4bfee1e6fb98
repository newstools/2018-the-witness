A dramatic police shootout in Montrose on Thursday evening left one man dead and two others injured. The evening of high drama started soon after 6.30 pm when police were hot on the heels of three armed suspected car thieves. The police gave chase darting between traffic along Townbush Road. The chase ended when the men crashed into a Ford Ranger, right on the doorstep of the Townhill Hospital. Police spokesperson Captain Thulani Zwane said the suspects shot at police and the police returned fire. Zwane said the men were suspected to have been involved in theft of motor vehicles in the Howick and Townhill area­s. “The police officers from the Pietermaritzburg K9 Unit and Flying Squad were conducting crime prevention duties in the Townhill area when they spotted a suspicious looking motor vehicle with three occupants,” Zwane said. “They attempted to stop the vehicle, however, the suspects sped off.” They allegedly started shooting at the officers, who returned fire and gave chase. Eventually, the suspects crashed their car into a civilian’s Ford Ranger. No one in the Ford was injured. One of the suspects was found dead in the vehicle and the other two men were found injured in some nearby bushes. It was unclear whether the dead man died from gunshot wounds or crash injuries.
