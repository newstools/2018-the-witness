An alleged lovers’ spat at the Pietermaritzburg Fidelity Cash in Transit offices left a 23-year-old Fidelity guard dead when her boyfriend allegedly shot and killed her inside the building on Thursday. Police and paramedics swarmed the back entrance to the offices in Greyling Street on Thursday as bystanders and other Fidelity guards waited to find out what had happened. It is alleged that a man in his 40s, who worked as the shift supervisor in the building, shot his 23-year-old lover with his service pistol eight times, before leaving the building and handing himself over to the police. The man is apparently married, according to work colleagues who asked not to be named. A woman, who asked not to be named, said she was in her office next to the Fidelity building at around 4 pm on Thursday when she heard the sound of gunfire. “We were in the office and the next minute we heard about 20 gunshots go off,” said the woman. “My boss rushed to one of the windows and looked down and saw a man standing by his car. He asked the man what he was doing and he told my boss to ‘f**k off’. “The gunshots were right next to us. We first thought it was a heist.” Paramedics and police worked for hours on Thursday afternoon trying to recover the woman’s body from the building. There was difficulty in removing her body, allegedly because of the number of security gates requiring finger prints to open and turnstiles in the building. Police have confirmed the incident, saying the man is in police custody and is expected to appear in the Pietermaritzburg Magistrate’s Court on Friday.
