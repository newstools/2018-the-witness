Carter High School Grade 12 pupils were all smiles after they wrote their first year-end English exam paper on Tuesday morning. Nandi Langa, Fanele Nyawo, Sya Msomi, Snothile Dlamini and Phumelele Mkhize were among thousands of matrics across the country who were writing their first exam paper on Tuesday. Speaking to The Witness, all five pupils agreed that the exam went well, but complained about the amount of time they were given to complete the paper — two hours for the English Home Language and First Additional Language papers, and two-and-a-half hours for the Second Additional Language paper. “If we were given even 30 minutes extra, I think I would’ve done exceptionally well; better than I think I did,” said Langa. The pupils were excited about their futures. “I want to study journalism at Nelson Mandela University next year, and I think the English comprehension prepared me well for all the writing involved in journalism,” said Nyawo. While some are already decided on which fields they want to study after matric, others are still undecided and say they will see when the time comes. “I know I want to study business science, but I’m still not sure where; I guess I’ll go wherever I am accepted,” said Msomi. “I don’t know what I want to do, there are so many options. All I know is I want to study something which will allow me to open a business in future,” said Dlamini. Speaking about their exam preparations, the pupils all agreed that meditation had helped. “Just study and pray,” they said
