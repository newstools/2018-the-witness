A movement that began as a simple protest against rising fuel prices has turned into a fully-fledged political party that will take part in next year’s election. The #MustFall movement, convened by local man Paul Jenkins, will be taking to the hustings next year, with its mandate focusing on curbing corruption, gender-based violence, and farm murders. A notice in the government gazette confirmed “Hashtag Must Fall” is the country’s newest political party. Jenkins told The Witness his goal for next year’s election was to win just a few seats in Parliament to begin to influence key decisions made for the country. He said the party will be the “green berets” of Parliament — decked in their signature lime green colours. “The people are tired of seeing where we’re going as a country. They see our political system is not working … and we want to save the country,” he said. “And the common thread among all lobby groups is that no matter what you do you get non-compliance from government. The only way to get any attention is to be an opposition in Parliament.” Jenkins emphasised that #MustFall had no leader per se, and would rather be run by a council of 10 people, who get voted in by members. He said the current council had representations from all groups. “Single-figure leader governments open up the potential for totalitarianism and corruption ...” #MustFall is now looking for funding before it begins campaigning, but Jenkins said it has drummed up a lot of support by using social media. He said the party had an “open-door policy, and encouraged people to come forward to contribute with ideas”.
