Grace College matrics had mixed reactions to Tuesday’s life sciences paper one exam. Speaking to The Witness, head boy Jason Tillett said the year-end exam was far easier than the trial exams. “It was better than I had expected, and this way I am positive that the overall marks will be pretty good,” he said. Deputy head boy Graeme Gibbs said he thought he wasn’t going to do too well after the trial exams, but the paper turned out okay. Head girl Megan Pluke said the paper didn’t have things she had expected to see in it, and deputy head girl Tarryn Plaatjies said she didn’t know how to feel about the paper. Some people have rituals or lucky charms that they cannot study without, and Ashley King said she had a ritual that she performed after every exam, and Pluke said she carried a toy chameleon everywhere she went. “I am very superstitious. Even though I do not want to jinx my results, I do kiss my paper goodbye after every exam,” said King. While King and Plaatjies are set on going to university, Gibbs, Tillett and Pluke said they were definitely taking a gap year. “I’m going to Stellenbosch to study English,” said King. “I’m also going to Stellenbosch, but I haven’t decided on what I am going to take between a BSc degree and Somatology where I can have a career as a beauty therapist or a salon manager,” said Plaatjies. Pluke said she was headed to London to be a student teacher, Gibbs said he was going to be a boarder master in New Zealand and Tillett said he was going to au pair. “My plan is to study a BSc if I get a bursary at the universities I have applied at. If not, then I am definitely going abroad to au pair,” he said. Speaking about their plans after their last exam, the pupils said they were all going to the beach. Schools under the Independent Examinations Board (IEB) will be writing English paper one next.
