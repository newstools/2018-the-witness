While some Pietermaritzburg petrol stations ran out of fuel on Tuesday ahead of the petrol price increase and a few experienced difficulties with deliveries, others had “no problems at all”. Cars and trucks choked petrol stations around Pietermaritzburg on Tuesday night as people filled their tanks before the huge increase in the price hit at midnight. The Hayfields Engen garage manager, Nhlanhla Khambule, said the station had been “very busy” and the garage did run out of fuel, “but only for an hour”. He said they ran out because there had been so many people who came to fill up their tanks, adding that plans had to be made to bring in more petrol. Caltex Bird Sanctuary manager Jan Botes said they had been “extremely busy” on Tuesday but did not run out of fuel. Three garages in Pietermaritzburg — Shell garage in Hilton, the BP garage at Cascades and another garage in the Athlone area — said they ran out of fuel due to the delivery truck breaking down. The truck that was to deliver fuel to the three garages broke down and was only able to supply the garages after almost nine hours of waiting.
