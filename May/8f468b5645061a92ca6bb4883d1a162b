Local magistrate Divesh Mootheram, who
stands accused of swearing at his boss, has hit back by handing in documents
showing that she and another senior staffer were investigated for allegedly
intimidating him and other magistrates. The documents show that Mootheram and two
colleagues had lodged grievances with the Magistrates Commission late last year
alleging they were “intimidated and victimised” by chief magistrate Mpho Evelyn
Monyemore and senior magistrate Ashin Singh. On Friday when Mootheram’s case came
before the Pietermaritzburg Magistrate’s Court his lawyer, Sanjay Sarawan,
handed in two letters that he said the defence wished to place on record. Mootheram hasn’t yet pleaded to the charge
but his lawyer has indicated that he will plead not guilty. The charge against Mootheram arises from
an allegation that he swore at Monyemore in April last year. One of the witnesses in the trial is
believed to be Singh. The letters emanate from the Magistrates
Commission. One is addressed to Mootheram and the other to retired senior
magistrate DC van Greuning. Dated October 10, 2017, the letter to
Mootheram is titled “Grievances lodged by yourself and other Magistrates”. It refers to a meeting held by the
Magistrates Commission on August 25 last year which considered grievances
lodged by Mootheram, Ms A. Bezuidenhout and Ms P.S. Joubert against Monyemore
and Singh. “The grievances relate to intimidation and
victimisation by the chief magistrate Ms Monyemore and Mr Singh in light of the
grievances lodged. Furthermore, in light of this they have now been rotated to
other courts without consultation.” It added that in light of the serious
allegations stemming from the documentation, the commission was referring the
matter to the ethics committee for consideration as the allegations are, “prima
facie, tantamount to serious misconduct”, the letter stated. It was signed by the secretary of the
commission, M. Dawood. The other letter is dated June 20 last
year, and addressed to Van Greuning. It is titled “Appointment to conduct a
preliminary investigation against Ms E Monyemore and Mr AAK Singh, respectively
chief magistrate and senior magistrate at Pietermaritzburg”. The letter confirmed the appointment
of  Van Greuning to conduct “a
preliminary investigation to obtain evidence with regard to the allegations and
all matters connected with or incidental thereto” in order to determine whether
there were any grounds for a charge of misconduct against Monyemore and Singh. It also instructed Van Greuning to compile
a report and recommend to the commission whether or not the two magistrates
should be charged with misconduct and, if so what the charge should be. It also said the report should reach the
commission on or before August 31, 2017. No documents were handed to court
indicating what became of these investigations. According to the charge sheet, Mootheram
is alleged to have unlawfully and intentionally “injured, insulted and
impaired” the dignity of Monyemore on April 11, last year. It is alleged that he said he “will get
rid of the corrupt black b***h” and/or “f**ken black b***h” and/or “f**ken
corrupt black b***h”. On Friday, presiding magistrate Ishwar
Dehaloo was informed that the state attorney will be assisting Mootheram to pay
for his defence. The case has been adjourned to June 22.
