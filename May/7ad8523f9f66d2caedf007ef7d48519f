Durban North now hosts the first medicinal
cannabis dispensary in Africa. Weekend Witness can reveal that the dagga
dispensary is the first of its kind on the continent. But don’t expect to buy any cannabis buds
at the  Holistic Relief Wellness and Pain
Management Centre. Instead a doctor, chiropractor or
traditional healer will consult and prescribe different strengths of oils
infused with cannabis and ayurvedic ingredients to their patients. These practitioners will schedule only
five patients at the same time. Krithi Thaver, founder of Canna Culture
and chair of the KZN branch of the Cannabis Development Council of SA, said the
aim of the dispensary is to set a benchmark for soon-to-be-legalised cannabis. “Our treatment regimens combine
traditional medical practices in chiropractics, physiotherapy, diseases and
illnesses (acute and chronic) to treat the whole body. The practitioners at
this centre are all medical professionals who have thoroughly researched the
extensive medical uses of cannabis and have enthusiastically embraced its
potential benefits.” He added a growing number of studies show
cannabis can be used safely, with zero to minimal negative side effects for a
wide range of curative benefits and successful pain management of any severity. “The global consensus is growing that the
hemp crop is in fact a ‘miracle’ plant and we are immensely pleased to be able
to finally offer this ‘miracle’ to Durban,” said Thaver. He said the dispensary has extended
invitations to both KZN’s health administrators and legal enforcers to attend
the official opening in the near future. As long as possession of any part of the
indigenous dagga plant remains illegal, patients need to be referred. “Marley coffee” and edibles will be sold
in a cafe area. Readers who are interested can contact
