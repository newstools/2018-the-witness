Maritzburg United wrapped up a successful 2017/18 season with a public parade through the streets of Pietermaritzburg on Monday. The local club finished fourth in the Absa Premiership for the first time in their history and were also runners-up in the Nedbank Cup knockout competition in Cape Town on Saturday night. Saturday’s outcome saw the Team of Choice miss out on the R7 million prize and a chance to cap off their remarkable campaign with silverware as solid proof of their success, going down 1-0 to Free State Stars in front of more than 10 000 fans. But despite the disappointing result, the local club remain proud of their achievements and this has prompted the city council to arrange the first ever public parade in the club’s history so they can celebrate their success with their fans. Club chairperson and managing director Farook Kadodia told The Witness he was satisfied as the side managed to fulfill their mandate. “It’s been an unbelievable achievement for the club. I really admire the coaches and the players for the fantastic work they have done this season. They have managed to make the supporters very proud this season. There are very few teams that play the brand of football that we play and that’s what the fans want to see. “The players and our fans deserve this for an amazing season we’ve had. We are sad for not coming back with the trophy, but we made our presence felt in Cape Town with the brand of football that we displayed. It was our first ever final and we wanted to experience it with our fans. I know it was a big sacrifice but they deserve it. “We are a young team and for most of the team it was their first Cup final. They will learn from this,” he said.
