Members of car clubs travelled from as far afield as Rustenburg and White River to show their rides at the annual Cars in the Park in Ashburton on Sunday. The event is SA’s oldest car show — the first event was held at Alexandra Park in Pietermaritzburg in February 1976 — and this year again attracted over 14 000 people to the Gold Circle at the Ashburton Training Centre, there to gawk at the vehicles on show. The vehicles ranged from lovingly polished Ford Model Ts from Vryheid’s Vintage Car Club to muddied Land Rovers with roof tents, to hot rod bakkies “tuned proper” to motorbikes and scooters. The spirit of the show is best summed up by a bumper sticker on one of the sports cars driven down by a group of Porsche enthusiasts from Randburg: “Life’s too short for boring cars”. Co-organiser Karl Habermann said apart from raising funds for local charities, the event has grown into a massive economic stimulus, injecting millions of rands into Msunduzi’s economy. He said the show this year saw 1 600 vehicles listed for display — 200 more than last year — and he estimated the crowd was also bigger this year than last year’s 1 400 people. The show this year enabled owners to list their cars in a silent auction, and Habermann said six offers have been received from buyers, who would now be linked to the sellers.
