With transfer activity in full force here and abroad, Maritzburg United head coach Fadlu Davids is assessing a Ghanaian midfielder-cum-striker, Daniel Darkwah, with a view of adding him to the squad. The Witness has been reliably informed that that the 26-year-old Ghanaian is currently in Pietermaritzburg to try his luck, having arrived from his homeland a week ago. The left-winger recently won the Ghana Premier League with Aduana Stars. He made 28 league appearances for the Ghanaian champs, scoring five goals in the process, and is also known for his creative ability. He also captained the Ghana Black Stars Chan team, and was also part of the Ghana squad that won the 2017 WAFU Cup of Nations. According to a source close to Darkwah back home, the player feels he is ready to move onto greener pastures and hopefully ply his trade in South Africa’s first tier. Should the deal materialise, he will join fellow countryman, goalkeeper Richard Ofori, who joined the PMB outfit from Wa All Stars at the beginning of the season. Kaizer Chiefs winger William Twala is also said to be among the Midlands side’s transfer targets, after they recently ended their interest in his Chiefs teammate Keagan Buchanan.
