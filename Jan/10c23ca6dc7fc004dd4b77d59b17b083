A Witness reader got the surprise of her life when she ran into the friendly face of the young man who used to sell her the newspaper every morning almost 20 years ago. Marline Turner (72) said she was “overjoyed” when she was greeted by the friendly Jabulani Gcwabe (42) who used to be a young newspaper seller in the late 1990s. “He looked all grown up and I was so happy when he told me that he was now working as a businessman,” said Turner. Turner recalled how she and her grandchildren would always bring treats and a hot drink for the friendly Jabulani who sold The Witness newspaper at the corner of Alan Paton Avenue and Blackburrow Road in Scottsville every morning. “When he greeted me at the supermarket I became so emotional. Everyone around us looked at us wondering what the fuss was all about because Jabulani and I kept on hugging and shaking each other’s hands. I was just so happy to see him,” she said. Gcwabe said he was also happy about running into Turner after so many years. “When I saw her I recognised her immediately. She and her grandchildren used to be very kind to me,” he said. Gcwabe said he now works for an accounting firm, Ndlovu Accounting & Business Consulting. “I worked as a newspaper seller for about five years but I had an accounting qualification. “Being on those streets played a huge part in getting me to where I am today. No matter what the weather was, I had to toughen up and work.  “I learnt how being friendly to my clients and potential clients helped boost my sales and I still use that trait today,” said Gcwabe. Turner said Gcwabe was an example that hard work does pay off. “Jabulani’s story teaches youngsters that it is possible to start from humble beginnings and still be able to do great things,” said Turner who has also shared the story with her grandchildren who were also “thrilled” about the reunion, she said.
