Pietermaritzburg - Just days after young mother, Bongeka Ngcobo (17) celebrated the return of her kidnapped baby boy, Sikhanyiso, her joy turned to tears.  Little Sikhanyiso died on Sunday after being rushed to a doctor.  Police spokesperson, Sergeant Mthokozisi Ngobese, told The Witness on Tuesday that the mother had taken the child to a doctor on Saturday.  He died the next day at home. Ngobese said that an inquest docket has been opened to determine the cause of death. A post-mortem is also taking place.  He said that at this stage, the woman suspected of abducting the baby has only been charged with kidnapping as there is no evidence indicating that she was responsible for the death. The woman was due to appear in court on Tuesday but the case was rolled over to Wednesday. The matter was adjourned in the woman’s absence by the Pietermaritzburg Magistrate’s Court.  State prosecutor Rene Padayachee told the magistrate that the 40-year-old woman was “busy with a confession” and was therefore unable to appear in the dock. The woman faces a charge of having kidnapped Sikhanyiso on December 18 on the corners of Boshoff and Langalibalele streets. Ngcobo had reported to police that she had allowed the suspect to carry the baby while she entered a shop and bought fresh chips at the woman’s request. When Ngcobo turned around, the woman was gone along with baby Sikhanyiso.  Police launched a rigorous search for the baby which ended happily with the baby boy being found on December 28. However, Ngcobo’s joy and immense relief at holding her precious child was short-lived as he died just days later.
