Former Sharks flyhalf Inny-Christian Radebe says it was very hurtful to part ways with the Durban-based side recently, but it’s a tough decision that needed to be taken for the sake of his future.  The four-year relationship between Radebe and the Sharks came to an end last month and the 23-year-old is without a club at the moment. His time with last year’s Currie Cup runners-up was plagued by injuries, which saw him spend more time on the sidelines than on the field. Speaking to The Witness on Tuesday, the injury-prone Radebe said the decision to leave the coastal outfit was entirely his own and motivated by a lack of game time. “Yes, I’ve got an early release from my contract. It was entirely on my behalf and it’s something that I requested,” said Radebe. “I did so because of a lack of opportunities, I wasn’t getting enough opportunities to play, so I decided to pursue my career elsewhere.  “It was very hurtful to leave the Sharks because I made a lot of good friends during my time there. That was my home, I was there for four years, so it was very sad to leave.”  The player, who came through the Sharks academy, said the technical team led by head coach Robert du Preez had tried to persuade him to stay, but he felt he would be more useful elsewhere. “It was really good to be with the Sharks, it was amazing and I learnt a lot. I don’t regret anything and really enjoyed my time there, that’s where I grew as a player,” said Radebe. The player was going to battle hard for game time against top flyhalves Curwin Bosch and Robert du Preez and the upcoming youngster Benhard Janse van Rensburg who are in the Sharks set-up. The flyhalf confirmed that he was recently on the verge of joining the Lions, a side he represented at Craven Week in the past, but he failed the medical exam. “I haven’t signed with anybody at the moment, so I can’t really say where I will be in the upcoming season. I nearly signed with the Lions, but things didn’t materialise,” he said.
