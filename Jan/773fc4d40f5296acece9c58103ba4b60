The uMgungundlovu District Municipality has outshone the rest by emerging as the highest performing in the province with a matric pass rate of 81,51%. The announcement was made on Friday by Education MEC Mthandeni Dlungwana at a special function held at the International Convention Centre in Durban where the province’s matric results were officially released, and pupils honoured. Dlungwana presented good news on the performance of the province, saying all 12 districts had improved. “The province has improved from a 66,4% pass rate in 2016 to 72,8% in 2017.” A total of 124 317 candidates sat for the national senior certificate, and 35 687 got bachelor passes to study at universities. He said the province has sustained a Grade 12 performance above 60% over the last two years and all the districts achieved an over 60% pass rate. Also, 109 schools got a 100% pass rate (up from 85 last year). Of these, 26 were from the uMgungundlovu District. While Maritzburg College was the overall star, with 257 writing and 257 passing, several of the schools were from more rural areas and two — Mabomvini Combined and Mayizekanye High — are “quintile ones”, the poorest of the poor schools. Last year, seven schools in the province received a zero percent pass. This year only three schools had a nil pass rate and there were no repeat offenders. Dlungwana said this proved that the interventions, including holding principals and regional and district managers accountable, had worked. He warned that heads would roll at the three errant schools, which are situated in the Ilembe, Zululand and Umkhanyakude districts. “It will not be business as usual. They will receive personal attention, we want to eliminate this category. They will be made accountable for their dismal performance. We are coming for them.” The MEC said the good performance can be attributed to many interventions including winter classes and residential holiday camps, weekend classes, and spring classes targeting schools with low performances and pupils at risk. He added that some districts did not respond positively to interventions and support by performing below the 70% pass rate. Necessary corrective measures will be put in place to push all districts above 70%. Meanwhile, the DA’s provincial education spokesperson, Dr Rishigen Viranna, said the provincial pass rate being up is a false reflection of the “true state of our schools”. The rate falls short of the 10% increase suggested by the MEC late last year and lags behind the DA-led Western Cape pass rate of 82,7%. “KZN’s 2017 matric results represent more broken promises by an ANC MEC in a province where the people have forgotten what real opportunity looks, tastes and feels like under an ANC government,” he added. The pass rate did not reveal many things such as: of the 193 942 matric pupils who registered in the province, 26 357 were progressed pupils and of these, only 5 310 wrote all their subjects; it excludes 21 047 of KZN’s weakest pupils who were “modularised” and who will only finish writing in July; and that 54 438 or 21,9% of pupils dropped out between Grade 10 and Grade 12 during the past two years. 1. uMgungundlovu (81,51%) 2.
