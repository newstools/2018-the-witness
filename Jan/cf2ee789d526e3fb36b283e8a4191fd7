A manhole on MacFarlane Road in the CBD remains uncovered a
month after the mayor allegedly made a promise to have it fixed. Last month The Witness reported that the missing manhole
cover on the narrow road was causing sewage to run down the road during heavy
rains. It was also being used as a dump by passers-by and vagrants, businesses
on the road said. Trisha Mathura, the owner of DMT Gas, originally alerted The
Witness to the issue. She said that Msunduzi Mayor Themba Njilo had then visited
the site and promised to have it fixed. “When the mayor came, workers came and cleaned the entire
street. They cleaned the sewage, they cleaned all the litter from the street,”
said Mathura. “We were told by some staff that they didn’t have [manhole]
lids like the one this manhole needs, because they can easily get stolen, but
we were told they would try to get a cover.” The manhole remains uncovered. “It still leaks sewage. We are contemplating getting a
private plumber to fix what needs fixing and then put a piece of metal on top
which we’ll need to weld down so no one takes it,” she said. “What more do we need to do? We put it in the paper and the
mayor came out. I don’t know what more we can do to get it fixed.” Mathura claimed she had tried contacting the mayor “to no
avail”. She had since logged a complaint through Msunduzi’s call centre. Msunduzi acting spokesperson Siyabonga Hlongwa was furnished
with a reference number and asked about the status of the situation via e-mail
last week but did not respond. Several calls to Njilo on Friday went unanswered. The Witness has reported on several cases of sewage pouring
from manholes.
