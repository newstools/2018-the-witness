After several fruitless efforts to extract a dassie from a car engine yesterday, the story ended happily when the animal effortlessly crawled out on its own and returned to its natural habitat. Sasha Rampal from Northdale told The Witness that her fiancé, Andrew Sebastian, who works at the Victoria Country Club, heard a funny noise coming from under the bonnet of his car while driving home on Tuesday afternoon. “When he got home we opened the bonnet to check. We saw a dassie [in the engine]. It quickly crawled out of his car bonnet and went into mine. “We tried getting it out but the little thing was stubborn, it kept moving around and it just seemed impossible to get it out,” she said. Rampal said her dogs also had a go at the little creature but it did not dare to come out. She said they thought the animal would be gone by morning, but to their dismay found that it was still tucked inside the engine. “I decided to drive straight to the SPCA. It was the most horrific drive of my life because I was scared I might hurt the dassie,” said Rampal. Maureen Vida, from the Pietermaritzburg SPCA, said all attempts to remove the dassie were in vain. “We tried everything but we just could not get it out. We had staff members and several SPCA customers all attempting to get the dassie out but it just wouldn’t budge,” she said. Vida said after assessing where the dassie was positioned, SPCA officials decided it was safe to drive the car back to the Victoria Country Club where it came from, even though the SPCA does not advise people to try driving a car while a live animal is under the bonnet. As though realising it was home, when the car arrived at the Victoria Country Club, the little creature jumped out of the car and went on its way. “We are just glad the animal was not injured and would also like to thank all the people who assisted in attempting to get the dassie out of the car,” said Vida.
