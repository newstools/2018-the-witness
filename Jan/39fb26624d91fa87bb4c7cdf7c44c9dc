Police have arrested a man who is believed to be a member of a syndicate that has been targeting upmarket homes in and around Pietermaritzburg. He was arrested on Saturday night on Slangspruit Road after police and private security companies received a tip-off. The man was driving a charcoal Audi A4 that matched the description of a vehicle involved in housebreakings in Wartburg, Northdale, Townhill and Hilton. Members of the Crime Intelligence unit, K9 Task Team and Magma security investigations arrested the suspect. In recent weeks police launched a major search for two cars allegedly involved in a spate of housebreakings and robberies. Reports of a silver VW Polo with a Newcastle registration plate and a charcoal Audi A4 being involved in housebreakings were circulated on several community security groups last year. “The suspect was arrested for possession of a stolen vehicle and unlicensed firearm,” said a police source. The source said it has emerged that the vehicle was stolen in Mayville. The charcoal Audi A4 was allegedly used in two housebreaking cases in December. In the first incident, suspects broke into a house in Hilton and tried to steal a television. However, the television set was too big to fit into the car and the burglars were seen on CCTV leaving it behind. It is believed that the same Audi was used during a break-in at a house in Townhill. Red Alert operations manager Avinash Sukai told The Witness at the time that footage from a guard hut showed the Audi leaving the area just after the break-in occurred. He said a Red Alert guard who was patrolling the area had spotted the Audi and a man holding a rifle outside the house. Pietermaritzburg police spokesperson Sergeant Mthokozisi Ngobese confirmed on Sunday that police had arrested a suspect. He is expected to appear in court on Monday.
