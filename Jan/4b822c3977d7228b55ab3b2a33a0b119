The case against a Pietermaritzburg man who masqueraded as a traffic officer was postponed on Monday after a brief appearance at the Pietermaritzburg Magistrate’s Court. Sboniso Danca (30) of Signal Hill is facing a charge of fraud after he allegedly extorted R3 000 from a motorist in November while impersonating a traffic officer. He was arrested at the beginning of January. It is alleged that in November Danca had allegedly told motorist Sakhumzi Epiphanus Dlamini that he was working with the Road Traffic Inspectorate and could help reduce traffic fines. The charge sheet indicates that Danca said he worked for Msunduzi Municipality as a traffic officer. On January 8 Danca was arrested while driving down Church Street, by Msunduzi Municipality’s acting traffic inspector Bheki Zondi. Zondi told The Witness at the time that he came across a silver Hyundai i20 that fitted the description of a car that was being used by a “fake traffic officer”. When Zondi stopped the car, he found that Danca had a traffic officer’s cap on display in his rear window and a blue light on his dashboard. He identified himself as a traffic officer from the Shanela operation. It later emerged that Danca’s traffic officer’s cap, blue light and badge belonged to his brother. During his appearance on Monday, the state said it intended to oppose bail as Danca’s profile and alternative address had not been verified. The car Danca was driving allegedly belonged to his girlfriend.
