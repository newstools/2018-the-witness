Illegal electricity connections have plunged the detective branch at Pietermaritzburg (Loop Street) police station into darkness since Tuesday. And this is seriously hampering service delivery, members of that unit told The Witness. Insiders said that Msunduzi workers last week said that the cause of the outage was a trip due to illegal connections by nearby businesses. But Msunduzi had still not attended to the problem. The issue has coincided with residents complaining of persistent illegal connections in several areas, namely Privet and Sirkhod roads in Raisethorpe and the Jika Joe informal settlement in Willowton. The Witness has run reports on the Privet Road issue before, with residents even meeting with police in an effort to get them to clamp down on a large informal settlement that was said to be stealing electricity. City spokesperson Thobeka Mafumbatha did not respond to a query on these issues. A member of the Loop Street station detective unit said: “Without electricity we can’t do any work whatsoever. Since Tuesday, we have been handed nearly 200 dockets, but we can’t scan them so if they go missing there is no back-up. “People are coming to us for updates of cases and we are not able to help them. This might even create a backlog in service delivery.” The member said a similar incident happened about two months ago, where the branch had no electricity for a week. LEAK FIXED Meanwhile there was some joy for a Northdale resident this week when the municipality after two years finally fixed a leak outside her property. But the resident, on Butterfly Road, has complained that the site has been left unsealed. “It’s now difficult to come out of the driveway, especially when it rains.” The resident feared the ongoing rains would clear out the debris used to fill the site, and it would become a pothole if not addressed soon.
