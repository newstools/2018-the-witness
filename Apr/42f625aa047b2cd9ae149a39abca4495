Former policeman Nkosinathi Shangase, who allegedly killed his nurse wife in Napierville two years ago, wants another chance at bail. Shangase appeared briefly in the Pietermaritzburg high court on Tuesday, ready to stand trial for allegedly murdering Thabisile Doyisa who was shot in the head at point-blank range with an R5 rifle. She had been employed as an advanced midwife at Edendale Hospital. His advocate, Shane Matthews, told the court that the defence and state had reached an agreement that the case be adjourned to next Monday for a bail application. He said Shangase has been in custody since 2016 and the state intends to apply for another postponement of the case because it is not ready to proceed with the trial. Matthews said: “The new investigation could result in the case not proceeding at all.” The state’s indictment alleges that the relationship between the couple had turned acrimonious and that Shangase decided to kill his wife. On the evening of April 22, 2016, it claims he waylaid her outside their house to execute his plan. When she arrived home from work, he fired several shots at her. Doyisa died at the scene as a result of “gunshot wounds into the head”. That same day, police searched Shangase’s safe at his house and found 83 live rounds of ammunition. During Shangase’s bail application in 2016, the court heard evidence that there was blood on his trousers and shoes when he was arrested soon after the murder. The primer residue test conducted on his hands was allegedly positive, indicating that he had recently fired a gun. However, Shangase told the court that he had nothing to do with the killing and will be pleading not guilty at his trial.
