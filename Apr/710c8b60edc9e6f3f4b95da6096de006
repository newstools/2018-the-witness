The KZN Midlands Youth Choir is returning home with a category win and three silver medals from the International Choir Festival in Wales. The young singers reached the final round of the contest and achieved scores of 80% to 89% in the young voices, mixed choir and open categories of the choral competition held in Cardiff on Saturday, March 31. The choir was invited to take part in the festival by organiser Eilir Owen Griffiths, following their successful performance at the Llangollen Eisteddfod in Wales last year. Proud parents watched the performances live, via Facebook. During the tour the choristers also gave impromptu performances at various spots around the Welsh capital. Sharing the music of Africa, they improvised the sounds of rain, wild dogs and even hadedas for crowds of onlookers. Choir director and conductor William Silk said: “The International Choral Festival in Wales has been an amazing experience; from fringe concerts in and around the wonderful city of Cardiff, to the competition itself, and workshops with Paul Mealor, the Royal composer, who was intrigued by our choir. “Getting a category win in the open category and three silvers and being invited to compete in the Choir of Choirs finals was an exhilarating experience,” said Silk. “In true SA fashion, our wonderful choristers have brought life to the festival and added a spirit that will be hard to replicate in future festivals. “I am very, very proud of our KZN Midlands Youth Choir,” he said. The competition was part of a 10-day tour of England and Wales, during which they visited Nelson Mandela’s statue in London, the ancient Roman baths in Bath and the historic site of the Stonehenge. Their final stop before returning home on Thursday, April 5, will be a visit to the Harry Potter Museum in Oxfordshire.
