Residents in Mountain Rise, Eastwood, Sobantu and surrounds have been bearing the brunt of a strong smell of sewage for years. They notice the smell most days “just before supper time”, adding that it gets worse after heavy rains. One resident said: “We recently had a few days of rain and the smell comes in the evening and it’s terrible. But we just have to live with it.” The resident said that about 10 years ago Msunduzi had a mass meeting with them about this problem. “They fixed the problem and for years everything was fine. But about three or four years ago it returned. Even if we close all doors and windows, the smell comes through,” he added. “We have tried complaining but I think most residents have just given up.” Residents assume the problem could be that the sewerage infrastructure can’t cope with growing population numbers. Meanwhile, residents along Jinnah Road in Northdale say Msunduzi has not attended to unkept grass for years. Thick bush creeps onto the pavement along the winding residential road. Residents said that despite their complaints, the problem persists with no end in sight. “People are also using these bushes as a place to dump rubbish,” one resident said. Msunduzi did not respond to a query.
