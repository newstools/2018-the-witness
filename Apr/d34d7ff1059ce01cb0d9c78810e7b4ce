Pietermaritzburg couple Steve and Eleanor Pienaar have made history by becoming the first South Africans to run in and complete the North Pole Marathon, earning them the prestigious “Grand Slam” title. They finished the race in just over nine hours on Sunday. The pair already have seven marathons on seven continents in seven years under their belts and have now become South Africa’s first couple to participate in and complete the North Pole Marathon — one of the toughest races in the world. The Pienaars were the first South African couple to become members of the prestigious Seven Continents Marathon Club in late 2016 after running the Antarctic Ice Marathon. They have now earned the Grand Slam title, running the marathon on moving sea ice in sub-zero conditions. Their finishing time was nine hours, one minute and 11 seconds. According to the North Pole Marathon’s Facebook page, Eleanor was placed fifth out of the 11 women who competed while Steve was placed 38th out of the 39 male competitors. The pair shared the same finishing time, meaning they were able to cross the finish line together. The Witness was unable to reach the couple yesterday but hopes to hear from them later today. Several friends have congratulated them on Facebook for their amazing feat.
