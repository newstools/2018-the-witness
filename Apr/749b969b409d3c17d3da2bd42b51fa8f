The Pietermaritzburg Home Affairs office says it has a plan to assist matriculants who encounter problems with applications for identity documents. The move was prompted by complaints from concerned parents who fear that their children may not get their identity documents in time in order to be eligible to write their matric final exams. Pietermaritzburg Home Affairs manager Xolani Maphumulo acknowledged that he had also received complaints from concerned parents who could not get into their offices to process applications. “We are trying to formulate a plan that will prioritise pupils. We find that it is best if they come during the week in their school uniform so they can easily be identified and assisted,” he said. Maphumulo said it becomes a challenge to identify pupils in the queues when they are not wearing their uniform. “It poses a challenge for us to select and identify the pupils if they are not wearing uniform. If they come anytime during the week before 9 am in their school uniform, we prioritise them on applications and collections.” He said they were also working with different schools that make appointments for pupils to come in and apply for identity documents. “We want to ensure that in cases where matriculants have not yet received their ID cards, we are able to expedite their applications so that they receive their cards. We will do our very best to remove from them the burden of having to worry about their identity cards before writing,” he added.
