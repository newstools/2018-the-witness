A woman was airlifted to St Augustine’s Hospital in Durban after she reportedly fell from a roof top tent at the Splashy Fen music festival, near Underberg, on Sunday. IPSS paramedics noted that the woman had sustained injuries to her neck, back and pelvis. Concerned that she might have a spinal injury, the on-site doctor called for the IPSS air ambulance. A helicopter, operated by Black Eagle aviation, flew into the festival site at 12.45 pm and transferred her to Durban. The Splashy organisers made an announcement over the loudspeakers to let campers know that there had been an accident and a helicopter had been summoned to assist with the care of the festival-goer. Stu Berry, festival director, said: “We couldn’t have asked for the incident to have been handled any better. “The patient slipped on her roof top tent steps and our medical team were superb in attending to her quickly and efficiently.”
