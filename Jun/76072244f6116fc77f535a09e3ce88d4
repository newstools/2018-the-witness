There still have not been any new developments in the case of the ashes that went missing at Msunduzi’s crematorium at Mountain Rise cemetery. The Witness reported on the plight of a Northdale family whose uncle Perumal Naidoo (52) died on May 25, and whose ashes went missing at the crematorium last Monday. Naidoo’s wife, Rumba Pillay, told The Witness on Wednesday that the family had still not recovered the ashes. Although there is a green urn with ashes at the crematorium, the family insist it is not theirs. “The funeral parlour informed us that it gave the crematorium a silver urn. The green one does not belong to us,” said Pillay. Pillay said the crematorium manager had informed the family that the silver urn was damaged and they had used a different one. The distressed family, who thought they were burying Naidoo last Monday, discovered that there had been a mix-up at the crematorium and they were given the wrong urn. It emerged that the ashes they buried were those of a man from Woodlands. “We are still trying to recover my husband’s ashes. We are not sure how we’ll be able to determine the right ashes but the funeral parlour has also offered to assist us.” What created more doubt, the family said was that the green box, which presumably had their rightful ashes, did not have a receipt with the name of the deceased attached to it. “We are hurting as a family because we have been deprived of our right to lay our relative to rest and to perform other cultural rites to find closure,” said Pillay.
