A policeman charged with killing his girlfriend has been denied bail as there is a possibility he might interfere with witnesses if he roams free. Pietermaritzburg magistrate Vincent Ncanyana said on Monday that “bail conditions will not be effective and can’t be enforced to take care of the fears of the witnesses”. Constable Doctor Sipho Chonco will be remanded in custody until June 26. He is alleged to have killed Wendy Dlamini on April 15 in Northdale. Chonco told the court he wanted bail to sort out his insurance policies. He also needed to cancel some as he was suspended without a salary. Chonco has said he intends to plead guilty. The magistrate said that the investigating officer, Norman Mthembu, spoke about the history between Chonco and Dlamini, and the crime. Mthembu said she had been abused by him and he even discharged a firearm at her. He also once fired shots at a neighbour he was upset with and had fired shots in the air at a KFC. Mthembu’s main reason for opposing bail was that Chonco might threaten the witnesses in this case. Dlamini’s aunt had told him that on one occasion when she was trying to assist her, Chonco phoned and threatened her. The magistrate said it was not disputed that Chonco was familiar with the witnesses in this case. “It seems like the state has a strong case against the accused [Chonco]. There is no suggestion from even him that the case is not strong. In his own words he said he wants to plead guilty,” said Ncanyana.
