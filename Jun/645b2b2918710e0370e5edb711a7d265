There is an African proverb that says “it takes a village to raise a child” — those are the words that drive KwaZulu-Natal philanthropist and hip-hop deejay Thulani Mzinyane’s spirit of Ubuntu. Mzinyane, popularly known as “DJ Dash”, is making waves on social media after embarking on a long walk from Johannesburg to Durban to raise funds to help build a new school for underprivileged children in the province. The 32-year-old from Clermont near Pinetown, through his organisation Feed a Child Feed a Nation, aims to alleviate poverty by providing necessities to under-resourced rural schools. Speaking to The Witness on Thursday from Mooi River, half way through his journey, Mzinyane said he took the stance to make a contribution instead of waiting for the government. “We can all make a difference by doing small things,” he said. “I believe that poverty contributes to the high rate of crime this country. We all have a responsibility to do more to ensure children are kept at school.” Mzinyane said losing his mother at a young age motivated him to start his organisation. “When I lost my mother, certain things were not okay. That experience moved me into a space where I wanted to help those who could be facing similar challenges,” he said. Although the project has received recognition on social media, Mzinyane urged people to continue donating. “I appreciate all the support and likes on social media but the aim is to raise funds. I urge the community, and especially business people, to come on board and support this initiative.” This is not the first walk undertaken by Mzinyane. In 2012, 2013, 2016 and 2017, Mzinyane walked hundreds of kilometres to raise funds. He said he walked from Richards Bay to Durban last year, as well as from Pretoria to Johannesburg. “The money I made from those events was used to buy food parcels and also donated to different schools around KwaZulu-Natal.”
