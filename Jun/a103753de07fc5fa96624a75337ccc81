Hundreds of South African Social Security Agency (Sassa) beneficiaries in the city were left in the lurch on Monday amid a nationwide strike over wages. Sassa workers, who are affiliated to the Public Servants Association (PSA) are demanding a 15% salary increase for entry level employees and a 13% increase for senior level employees, which their employer has not responded to. The workers are also demanding that the current housing allowance be increased to R2 500 and that the allowance be paid to all workers individually, including spouses who are employees of Sassa. However, the strike has temporarily been called off following a constructive consultation with Social Development Minister Susan Shabangu, the Public Servants Association (PSA) revealed in a statement late on Monday. At the Sassa office at the Northdale Civic hall, many beneficiaries were turned away on Monday as the workers downed tools. On Bank Street in the CBD, employees who were holding up placards staged a picket outside the Pietermaritzburg Sassa head office from 8 am until midday and thereafter shutdown all services. In the city centre, workers at another office in Pietermaritz Street, near the Imbali taxi rank, were on a go-slow. PSA provincial manager Claude Naicker said the union tabled a wage demand on behalf of its members in February but Sassa failed to table any counter-offer. Naicker said in terms of the constitution of the Sassa National Bargaining Forum (SNBF), if parties do not conclude a collective agreement within 30 days of the matter being tabled, any party may declare a dispute. PSA national general manager Ivan Fredericks said Shabangu requested time to consult with the relevant stakeholders and undertook to revert back to the PSA at a follow-up meeting on Thursday.
