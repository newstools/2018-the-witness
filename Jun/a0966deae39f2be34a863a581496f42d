A local pensioner wants her money back after she believes she was defrauded by a local South African Social Security Agency (Sassa) employee. Sibongile Ndimande (60) from Sobantu said she was “confused and stressed” after realising that her first pension payment at the beginning of June was paid into someone else’s account. She said when the payout dididn’t come, she panicked. Ndimande visited the local Sassa offices but they said she had been paid and advised her to visit her bank. At the bank she was told that the bank account on her Sassa documentation did not correspond to her bank account number. “The young man at the bank found that the bank account belonged to one of their clients and called him. “I don’t know if it was a coincidence or what but the person who the money was paid to is a local man and has the same surname as the person who had assisted me at Sassa when my pension was processed.” Ndimande alleged that the man who the money was paid to admitted that he received the payment but said he could not pay it back as he had already used it. Ndimande went back to the Sassa offices and asked that they change her banking details. She said the manager could not tell her how the money ended up in the wrong bank account. “They promised I will be getting my pension next month but what do I do this month? My family is totally dependent on this money and we don’t have anything.” Sassa spokesperson Vusi Mahaye said it was not Sassa that defrauded Ndimande but an individual. “We will follow up the matter to see what really happened. “We will also be in touch with her [Ndimande] to arrange that she be compensated as what happened was not her fault,” said Mahaye. Ndimande has opened a case of fraud. A police spokesperson said there have been no arrests.
